Detecting security vulnerabilities relating to cryptographically-sensitive information carriers when testing computer software
A system for detecting security vulnerabilities in computer software, including a cryptographic API identifier configured to identify a cryptographic API among the instructions of a computer software application, a path-to-source tracer configured to trace an information flow path among the instructions between the cryptographic API and a source that directly or indirectly provides data that are input to the cryptographic API, where a cryptographically-sensitive information carrier lies along the information flow path, a path-to-sink tracer configured to trace an information flow path among the instructions from the cryptographically-sensitive information carrier to a sink, and a security vulnerability identifier configured to provide a notification that the information flow path between the cryptographically-sensitive information carrier and the sink represents security vulnerability if the information flow path between the cryptographically-sensitive information carrier and the sink does not pass through a cryptographic API.
