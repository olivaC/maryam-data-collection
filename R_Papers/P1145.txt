Dexpler: converting android dalvik bytecode to jimple for static analysis with soot
This paper introduces Dexpler, a software package which converts Dalvik bytecode to Jimple. Dexpler is built on top of Dedexer and Soot. As Jimple is Soot's main internal representation of code, the Dalvik bytecode can be manipulated with any Jimple based tool, for instance for performing point-to or flow analysis.
