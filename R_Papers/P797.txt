Managing access to secured content
Techniques for preventing unauthorized access to protected network resources include accessing, from a client appliance connected in a distributed network, a computing appliance through the world wide web, the computing appliance including a DNS server addressed by a particular domain name; receiving, from the computing appliance, a portion of code at the client appliance through a web browser of the client appliance, receiving, to a server appliance connected in the distributed network, a request to access secure content stored on the server appliance by the portion of code; comparing the domain name of the DNS server with a server-origin of the secure content; and based on the domain name of the DNS server being exclusive of a set of server-origin values that includes the server-origin, denying access to the request.
