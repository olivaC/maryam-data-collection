(In)Security of Backend-as-a-Service
Since recent years, more and more tasks in personal data processing are performed by smartphone applications. Users store and manage an increasing amount of sensitive information inside these apps and expect the data to be available across devices and platforms. Application developers, on the other hand, are pressed to deliver new applications faster and with more features. As a consequence, they outsource tasks such as backend provisioning to specialized service providers. In this paper, we perform a study on the security of Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and its practical use in real-world Android and iOS applications. As we show, many apps embed hard-coded credentials, putting not only the userâ€™s data, but the whole platform at risk. We show that with current tools attackers can gain access to huge amounts of sensitive data such as millions of verified e-mail addresses, thousands of health records, complete employee and customer databases, voice records, etc. Often, one can manipulate, and delete records at will. Some BaaS instances even suffer from remote code-execution vulnerabilities. We provide HAVOC, a fully-automated tool for finding potentially vulnerable applications and a fully-automated exploit generator that extracts the required credentials from the app and checks their validity with the BaaS backend. We analyzed over 2,000,000 applications from the Google Play Store and alternative markets and found over 1,000 backend credentials, many of them re-used in several applications. In total over all apps, we found that more than 18,670,000 records with over 56,000,000 individual data items were freely accessible.
