Static code analysis for packaged application customization
A method for static code analyzing customizations to a pre-packaged computing solution can include establishing a communicative connection from a recommendation generation module to a pre-packaged computing solution and authenticating into the pre-packaged computing solution. Customized program code can be extracted from the pre-packaged computing solution and a call graph of the customized program code can be constructed such that the call graph indicates method calls to different interfaces for program code of the pre-packaged computing solution. Finally, a report can be generated identifying customized program code to be adapted to a new version of the pre-packaged computing solution based upon changes in the different interfaces shown by the call graph to be used in the new version of the pre-packaged computing solution and modifications required for the customized program code to call the different interfaces in the new version of the pre-packaged computing solution.
