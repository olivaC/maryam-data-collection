Attacks on the Network
By executing a network attack, an attacker is able to eavesdrop on a user’s traffic, or even manipulate the traffic while it is in transit. By itself, the scope of a network attack is limited to inspecting and manipulating traffic on the network. However, this capability often serves as a stepping stone, resulting in an escalation towards impersonating the user, taking control of the user’s browser, etc. In this chapter, we cover three varieties of network attacks. First, we discuss an eavesdropping attack, where the attacker listens in on the traffic being sent. Next, we cover man-in-the-middle attacks, where the attacker can also manipulate the traffic while in transit. Finally, we discuss attacks on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) protocol, which uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to offer certain security guarantees.
