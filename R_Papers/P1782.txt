An overview of the Oregon programming languages summer school
The Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) has been held at the University of Oregon each summer since 2002. We believe it has been an unqualified success in providing students and instructors a unique opportunity to study relevant background and cutting-edge results in the field of programming languages research. As the current steering committee and organizers for OPLSS, we appreciate the opportunity to provide an overview of the summer school. This short article describes the format, history, goals, and support for the OPLSS.
