Building coverage metrics and testing strategies for mobile testing via view enumeration
A method and method for testing an application includes performing a static analysis of metadata of coding of an application, using a test application program executed by a processor on a computer. Available user interface states are simulated based on the static analysis. A configuration file of the application is accessed and parsed to enumerate states possible for the application. A coverage metric is calculated for the application based on a number of states reached by the simulating and a number of states possible.
