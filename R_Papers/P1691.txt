History repeats itself more easily when you log it: Versioning for mashups
Web mashup environments provide a way for users to combine data from web applications and services to create new content. Currently, these environments do not provide support for tracking the development histories of mashups. We have thus added configuration management support to the Yahoo! Pipes mashup environment. We describe this support, and provide results of an experiment studying the ability of programmers to create and debug mashups in its presence. Our results show that versioning support can help both groups of users do both tasks better.
