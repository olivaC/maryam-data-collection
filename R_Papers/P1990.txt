System, method and apparatus for preventing vulnerable interleavings in web applications at compile time
Systems, methods, and computer program products are disclosed including receiving a computer program, compiling the computer program, performing data flow analysis on the computer program to identify accesses to data locations by execution units at compile-time, generating a list of data-flow paths including accesses to one or more of the data locations, determining that more than one of the execution units accesses the same data location based on the list of data-flow paths, determining the existence of a potential vulnerability in at least one of the data-flow paths based at least in part on the determination that more than one of the execution units accesses the same data location, synthesizing a scheduling constraint for the data location based at least in part on the determination of the existence of the potential vulnerability in the at least one of the data-flow paths, and implementing the scheduling constraint for the data location
