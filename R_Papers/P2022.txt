Testing application internal modules with instrumentation
Testing internal modules of application code includes applying, via a computer processor, instrumentation hooks to internal module interface points and external module interface points of the application code, executing the application code and recording values received at the instrumented interface points, determining an accessible internal module input point and a constraint based on the recorded values from the instrumented external module interface points, and testing the accessible internal module input point based on the constraint.
