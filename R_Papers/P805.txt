LogSec: adaptive protection for the wild wild web
Today, a Web browser is a user's gateway to a multitude of Web applications, each with its own balance between confidentiality and integrity versus cross-application content sharing. Modern Web browsers apply the same permissive security policy to all content regardless of its demand for security -- a behavior that enables attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or sidejacking. To defend against such attacks, existing countermeasures enforce overly strict policies, which expose incompatibilities with real-world Web applications. As a consequence, users get annoyed by malfunctions. In this paper, we show how browser behavior can be adapted based on the user's authentication status. The browser can enforce enhanced security policies, if necessary, and permit modern communication features, if possible. Our approach mitigates CSRF, session hijacking, sidejacking, and session fixation attacks. We present the implementation as a browser extension, named LogSec, that passively detects the user's authentication status without server-side support and is transparent for the user.
