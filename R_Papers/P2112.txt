Importance-based call graph construction
Call graph construction systems that utilize computer hardware are presented including: a processor; a candidate pool configured for representing a number of calls originating from a root node of a computer software application; an importance value assigner configured for assigning an importance value for any of the number of calls represented in the candidate pool; a candidate selector configured for selecting from the number of calls represented in the candidate pool for inclusion in a call graph based on a sufficient importance value; and an importance value adjuster configured for adjusting the importance value of any call represented in the call graph.
