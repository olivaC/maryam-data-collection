Application testing system and method
A method, computer program product, and computer system for sending, by a first computing device, a payload from a plurality of payloads to a second computing device. A response from the second computing device responding to the payload is received at the first computing device. It is determined whether the payload has successfully attacked an application executing at the second computing device based upon, at least in part, the response. If not, at least a portion of the plurality of payloads that shares a structural overlap with the first payload is identified. At least a second payload of the portion is prevented from being sent to the second computing device in response to identifying that the second payload shares the structural overlap with the first payload.
