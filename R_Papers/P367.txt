Simcotest: a test suite generation tool for simulink/stateflow controllers
We present SimCoTest, a tool to generate small test suites with high fault revealing ability for Simulink/Stateflow controllers. SimCoTest uses meta-heuristic search to (1) maximize the likelihood of presence of specific failure patterns in output signals (failure-based test generation), and to (2) maximize diversity of output signal shapes (output diversity test generation). SimCoTest has been evaluated on industrial Simulink models and has been systematically compared with Simuilnk Design Verifier (SLDV), an alternative commercial Simulink testing tool. Our results show that the fault revealing ability of SimCoTest outperforms that of SLDV. Further, in contrast to SLDV, SimCoTest is applicable to Simulink/Stateflow models in their entirety.
