Biting the hand that serves you: A closer look at client-side flash proxies for cross-domain requests
Client-side Flash proxies provide an interface for JavaScript applications to utilize Flashâ€™s cross-domain HTTP capabilities. However, the subtle differences in the respective implementations of the same-origin policy and the insufficient security architecture of the JavaScript-to-Flash interface lead to potential security problems. We comprehensively explore these problems and conduct a survey of five existing proxy implementation. Furthermore, we propose techniques to avoid the identified security pitfalls and to overcome the untrustworthy interface between the two technologies.
