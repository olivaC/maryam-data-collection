Static security analysis using a hybrid representation of string values
Methods for creating a hybrid string representation include determining string components from input string information that may be represented concretely by comparing the one or more components to a set of known concretizations using a processor. The set of known concretizations includes string configurations that cannot be interfered with by an attacker. All string components that could not be represented concretely are abstracted. A hybrid string representation is created that includes at least one concrete string component and at least one abstracted string component.
