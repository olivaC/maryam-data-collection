Performance testing of web components using identity information
Performance testing of web components using identity information includes providing a web component for testing having business logic code and an associated authorization layer code, locating, using a processor, branches in the authorization layer code and the business logic code which are dependent on identity information, and creating, using the processor, symbolic identities with claims or attributes having values corresponding to the branch options of the located branches. The method also includes propagating the symbolic identities downstream from the branch locations through the authorization layer code and the business logic code and analyzing, using the processor, the performance of each symbolic identity.
