Experiences of applying UML/MARTE on three industrial projects
MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems) is a UML profile, which has been developed to model concepts specific to Real-Time and Embedded Systems (RTES). In previous years, we have applied UML/MARTE to three distinct industrial problems in various industry sectors: architecture modeling and configuration of large-scale and highly configurable integrated control systems, model-based robustness testing of communication-intensive systems, and model-based environment simulator generation of large-scale RTES for testing. In this paper, we report on our experiences of solving these problems by applying UML/MARTE on four industrial case studies. Based on our common experiences, we derive a framework to help practitioners for future applications of UML/MARTE. The framework provides a set of detailed guidelines on how to apply MARTE in industrial contexts and will help reduce the gap between the modeling standards and industrial needs.
