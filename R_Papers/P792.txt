Transparent Namespace-Aware Mechanism for Encrypted Storage of Data within Web Applications
Implementations of the present disclosure include methods, systems, and computer-readable storage mediums for providing data security in web applications operating offline, and actions include receiving a request from a user of a web application during offline use of the web application in a web browser, the request implicating a data item, receiving an offline password from the user, decrypting an encrypted offline key to provide an offline key, and selectively using the offline key to process the data item based on a data protection policy stored in storage of the web browser and a protection level assigned to the data item.
