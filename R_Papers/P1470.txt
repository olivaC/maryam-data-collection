ACM SIGSOFT FSE 2014 Conference Summary
The 22nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2014) was held in Hong Kong from November 16 to 21, 2014. The conference brought together over 400 researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, and challenges in software engineering. This year's program continues the great tradition of previous FSE meetings by being rich and exciting, but the location of the conference was particularly noteworthy---for the first time, this major international software engineering conference was held outside North America. Hong Kong is renowned as a lively city with a beautiful harbor and landscape, and is famous for its finance, shopping, and gourmet cuisine, blending Eastern and Western cultures.
