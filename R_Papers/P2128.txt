Progressive static security analysis
A disclosed method includes determining modifications have been made to a program and deriving data flow seeds that are affected by the modifications. The method includes selecting one of the data flow seeds that are affected by the modifications or data flow seeds that are not affected by the modifications but that are part of flows that are affected by the modifications and performing a security analysis on the program. The security analysis includes tracking flows emanating from the selected data flow seeds to sinks terminating the flows. The method includes outputting results of the security analysis. The results comprise one or more indications of security status for one or more of the flows emanating from the selected data flow seeds. At least the deriving, selecting, and performing are performed using a static analysis of the program. Apparatus and program products are also disclosed.
