Novel applications of machine learning in software testing
Machine learning techniques have long been used for various purposes in software engineering. This paper provides a brief overview of the state of the art and reports on a number of novel applications I was involved with in the area of software testing. Reflecting on this personal experience, I draw lessons learned and argue that more research should be performed in that direction as machine learning has the potential to significantly help in addressing some of the long-standing software testing problems.
