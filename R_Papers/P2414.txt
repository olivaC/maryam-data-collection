A highly parallel reuse distance analysis algorithm on gpus
Reuse distance analysis is a runtime approach that has been widely used to accurately model the memory system behavior of applications. However, traditional reuse distance analysis algorithms use tree-based data structures and are hard to parallelize, missing the tremendous computing power of modern architectures such as the emerging GPUs. This paper presents a highly-parallel reuse distance analysis algorithm (HP-RDA) to speedup the process using the SPMD execution model of GPUs. In particular, we propose a hybrid data structure of hash table and local arrays to flatten the traditional tree representation of memory access traces. Further, we use a probabilistic model to correct any loss of precision from a straightforward parallelization of the original sequential algorithm. Our experimental results show that using an NVIDIA GPU, our algorithm achieves a factor of 20 speedup over the traditional sequential algorithm with less than 1% loss in precision.
