Automatic generation of analysis-equivalent application constructs
A computer program to be subjected to static analysis includes at least one framework, in turn including high-level code and at least one configuration file. A specification which describes run-time behavior of the program, including run-time behavior of the at least one framework including the high-level code and the at least one configuration file, is created from the computer program. Based on the specification, synthetic high-level code which accurately simulates the run-time behavior of the at least one framework including the high-level code and the at least one configuration file, without framework usage, is created. Static analysis of the computer program is carried out based on the synthetic high-level code.
