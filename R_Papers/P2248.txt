Scenario-based crawling
An interactive session can be established between a crawling bot and a Web site. The crawling bot can defines a session state representing a user state for interacting with one or more Web sites, a set of conditions, and a set of scenarios to be selectively activated based on whether the set of conditions are satisfied. The crawling bot can receive content from the Web site during the interactive session. The crawling bot can parse the content from the Web site and can matching the parsed content against a previously defined set of items to determine whether the content matching condition is satisfied. If the content matching condition is satisfied and if the state condition is satisfied, the crawling bot, activating of the scenarios defined by the crawling bot can be active, which is not activated if the content matching condition and the state condition are not satisfied.
