Service choreography and orchestration with conversations
Service oriented computing provides technologies that enable multiple organizations to integrate their businesses over the Internet. Typical execution behavior in this type of distributed systems involves a set of autonomous peers interacting with each other through messages. Modeling and analysis of interactions among the peers is a crucial problem in this domain due to following reasons: 1) Organizations may not want to share the internal details of the services they provide to other organizations. In order to achieve decoupling among different peers, it is necessary to specify the interactions among different services without referring to the details of their local implementations. 2) Modeling and analyzing the global behavior of this type of distributed systems is particularly challenging since no single party has access to the internal states of all the participating peers. Desired behaviors have to be specified as constraints on the interactions among different peers since the interactions are the only observable global behavior. Moreover, for this type of distributed systems, it might be worthwhile to specify the interactions among different peers before the services are implemented. Such a top-down design strategy may help different organizations to better coordinate their development efforts.
