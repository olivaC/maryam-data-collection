Automated discovery of programmatic resources
A method for business process to customized program code mapping in a pre-packaged computing solution can include establishing a connection from a business process to code mapping module executing in memory by a processor of a computer to a source pre-packaged computing solution, extracting both a business process hierarchy (BPH) and customized program code from the source pre-packaged computing solution, storing the BPH and the extracted customized program code in storage coupled to the computer, selecting a business process in the BPH and mapping the selected business process to corresponding portions of the customized program code, and generating and displaying in the computer a dependency graph indicating dependency relationships of the mapped portions of the customized program code for the selected business process of the BPH of the source pre-packaged computing solution.
