Profiling android vulnerabilities
In widely used mobile operating systems a single vulnerability can threaten the security and privacy of billions of users. Therefore, identifying vulnerabilities and fortifying software systems requires constant attention and effort. However, this is costly and it is almost impossible to analyse an entire code base. Thus, it is necessary to prioritize efforts towards the most likely vulnerable areas. A first step in identifying these areas is to profile vulnerabilities based on previously reported ones. To investigate this, we performed a manual analysis of Android vulnerabilities, as reported in the National Vulnerability Database for the period 2008 to 2014. In our analysis, we identified a comprehensive list of issues leading to Android vulnerabilities. We also point out characteristics of the locations where vulnerabilities reside, the complexity of these locations and the complexity to fix the vulnerabilities. To enable future research, we make available all of our data.
