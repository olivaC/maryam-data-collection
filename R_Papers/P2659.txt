Analyzing power consumption in mobile computing devices
Techniques pertaining to analyzing power consumed by a processing unit in a mobile computing device caused by execution of certain modules are described herein. A power trace is generated that indicates an amount of power consumed by the processing unit over time, and the power trace is aligned with an execution log. Spikes are extracted from the power trace, and computing operations are performed over the spikes to acquire data pertaining to power consumed by the processing unit that are attributable to modules in the execution log.
