Analyzing The Software Bug Lifecycle
We describe the Impendulo tool suite and how we use it to analyze how programmers develop code and more importantly how they introduce and correct errors. In addition we also evaluate state-of-the-art static analysis tools to see whether they can detect the errors the programmers introduce. Our results indicate that these tools find almost no errors. This clearly shows that we need to develop new static analysis tools if we want to improve the software development process. We also illustrate how the results of our programmer observations can be used to determine programmer performance in an objective fashion.
