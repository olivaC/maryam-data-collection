The FITTEST tool suite for testing future internet applications
Future Internet applications are expected to be much more complex and powerful, by exploiting various dynamic capabilities For testing, this is very challenging, as it means that the range of possible behavior to test is much larger, and moreover it may at the run time change quite frequently and significantly with respect to the assumed behavior tested prior to the release of such an application. The traditional way of testing will not be able to keep up with such dynamics. The Future Internet Testing (FITTEST) project (http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/fittest/), a research project funded by the European Commission (grant agreement n. 257574) from 2010 till 2013, was set to explore new testing techniques that will improve our capacity to deal with the challenges of testing Future Internet applications. Such techniques should not be seen as replacement of the traditional testing, but rather as a way to complement it. This paper gives an overview of the set of tools produced by the FITTEST project, implementing those techniques.
