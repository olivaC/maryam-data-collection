Integrate semantic interference detection into version management system
Global software developments intensify parallel changes. Although parallel changes can improve performance, their interferences contribute to faults. Current Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems can detect the interference between changes at textual level. However, our empirical study shows that, compared with textual interference, semantic approach is more effective and efficient in detecting interference in high-degree parallel changes. We propose to integrate semantic interference checking into SCM system. Semantic interferences detected during check in can alert developers to potential faults.
