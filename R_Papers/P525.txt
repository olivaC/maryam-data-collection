Automatically deriving UML sequence diagrams from use cases
Use cases are commonly used to structure and document requirements during requirement elicitation while sequence diagrams are often used during the analysis phase to document use cases as objectsâ€™ interactions. Since creating such sequence diagrams is mostly manual, automated support would provide significant, practical help. Additionally, traceability could be easily established through automated transformation, which could then be used for instance to relate requirements to design. In this paper, we propose an approach and a tool to automatically generate sequence diagrams from use cases while establishing traceability links. We validate our approach with six case studies, where we compare sequence diagrams generated by our tool to the ones devised by experts and trained 4th year undergraduate students. Results show that sequence diagrams automatically generated by our tool are highly consistent with the ones devised by experts and are also very complete. Results also show that the automatically generated diagrams are far more complete than the ones manually created by students. These encouraging results suggest that our approach and tool would indeed provide significant, practical help to engineers creating (initial) sequence diagrams from use case descriptions.
