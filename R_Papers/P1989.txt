System, method and apparatus for fine-grained privacy specification and verification
A method includes receiving from a user via a user interface an activation of at least one element to set a privacy policy specifying the maximum amount of confidential data that is authorized to be leaked to a sink, tracking movement of confidential data through an application, determining based on the tracked movement of the confidential data that the confidential data is leaked to the sink by the application, comparing the confidential data that is leaked to the sink to the specified maximum amount of confidential data that is authorized to be leaked to the sink, and presenting to the user via the user interface an indication of whether the application complies with the privacy policy set by the user based on the comparison.
