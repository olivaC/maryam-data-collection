Industrial application of concolic testing on embedded software: Case studies
Current industrial testing practices often build test cases in a manual manner, which is slow and ineffective. To alleviate this problem, concolic testing generates test cases that can achieve high coverage in an automated fashion. However, due to a large number of possible execution paths, concolic testing might not detect bugs even after spending significant amount of time. Thus, it is necessary to check if concolic testing can detect bugs in embedded software in a practical manner through case studies. This paper describes case studies of applying the concolic testing tool CREST to embedded Applications. Through this project, we have detected new faults in the Samsung Linux Platform (SLP) file manager, Samsung security library, and busy box ls.
