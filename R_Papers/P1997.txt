System, method and apparatus for extracting usage-based fine grained permissions
A fine grained permission method and system that parameterizes permissions based on an objective criterion. The method includes accessing libraries of application programs requiring a permission, automatically extracting types of the parameters and respective corresponding fields read by the libraries requiring the permission, filtering the extracted types of parameters and fields based on a usage criteria to determine a filtered type of parameter and field for the permission and storing the filtered type parameter and field for the permission in a database. A request for a permission is passed to a fine grained permission module which obtains the filtered type of parameter and field for the permission, determines a specific parameter for the permission based on the filtered type of parameter and field and parameterizes the permission using the specific parameter. Downloading of the application program is completed by limiting the permission based on the specific parameter.
