X-JOAF: An eXtensible Java Optimization Framework
Compiler optimizations have been the target of research for many years. Java has received a lot of this attention due to its object-oriented nature and its many advanced features that lead to inefficient generated code. Many optimization frameworks, such as Soot, exist with the goal of optimizing Java through an intermediate representation. In this paper, we present X-JOAF which is an experimental framework similar to Soot, but deals with an untyped three-address code Intermediate Representation. This paper presents the core infrastructure of X-JOAF, and details of the transformations involved as well as the results from this experiment
