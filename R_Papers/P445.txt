Coverage-based test case prioritisation: An industrial case study
This paper presents an industrial case study of coverage-based prioritisation techniques on a real world system with real regression faults. The study evaluates four common and different test case prioritisation techniques and examines the effects of using various coverage criteria on the fault detection rates of the prioritised test suites. The results show that prioritisation techniques that are based on additional coverage with finer grained coverage criteria perform significantly better in fault detection rates. The study also reveals that using modification information does not significantly enhance fault detection rates.
