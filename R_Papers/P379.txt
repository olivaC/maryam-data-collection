Making Model-Driven Verification Practical and Scalable-Experiences and Lessons Learned.
• In most research endeavors, applicability and scalability are an afterthought, a secondary consideration, when at all considered • Implicit assumptions are often made, often unrealistic in any context • Problem definition in a vacuum • Not adapted to research in an engineering discipline • Leads to limited impact • Research in model-based V&V is necessarily multi-disciplinary • Industrial case studies and user studies are required and far too rare • In engineering research, there is no substitute to reality
