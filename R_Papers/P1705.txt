Directed test suite augmentation
As software evolves, engineers use regression testing to evaluate its fitness for release. Such testing typically begins with existing test cases, and many techniques have been proposed for reusing these cost-effectively. After reusing test cases, however, it is also important to consider code or behavior that has not been exercised by existing test cases and generate new test cases to validate these. This process is known as test suite augmentation. In this paper we present a directed test suite augmentation technique, that utilizes results from reuse of existing test cases together with an incremental concolic testing algorithm to augment test suites so that they are coverage-adequate for a modified program. We present results of an empirical study examining the effectiveness of our approach.
