Classification of code constructs using string analysis
A code construct in a computer-based software application is classified by seeding an analysis of an instruction code set of a computer-based software application with a seed for a seeding variable within the instruction code set, wherein the seed is an abstract value representation, performing the analysis to a fixed point, thereby producing a fixed point solution, selecting an invariant from the fixed point solution, wherein the invariant represents at least one value pointed to by a classification variable in a code construct within the instruction code set, and classifying the code construct with a classification that is applicable to the invariant in accordance with an application criterion.
