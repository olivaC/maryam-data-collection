Identification of read/write chains during static analysis of computer software
A system for identifying read/write chains in computer software, including a static analysis engine identifying within computer software logical container accesses, a string analyzer configured to at least partly resolve any variables identifying the logical container in any of the accesses by determining a set of potential values of any of the variables, and a Logical Container Access Virtualization component (LCAV) configured to identify the type and scope of any permutations of the accesses, where each of the permutations is defined by substituting any of the potential values for any of the access variables, and identify any read/write chains within the computer software by matching any of the access permutations that read from the logical container with any of the access permutations that write to the logical container if there is an intersection between the scopes of the read and write access permutations.
