Constraint-based evolutionary testing of autonomous distributed systems
Distributed software systems are characterized by in- creasing autonomy. They often have the capability to sense the environment and react to it, discover the presence of other systems and take advantage of their services, adapt and re-configure themselves in accordance with the inter- nal as well as the global state. Testing this kind of systems is challenging, and systematic and automated approaches are still missing. We propose a novel evolutionary testing framework for autonomous distributed systems. In this framework, test cases are continuously generated and executed. Our cur- rent implementation of the framework provides two tech- niques for the automated, continuous generation of test cases: (1) random; (2) evolutionary-mutation. Preliminary experimental results, obtained on a case study, are encour- aging and indicate that evolutionary testing can comple- ment effectively the manual one.
