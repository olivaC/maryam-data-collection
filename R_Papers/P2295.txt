Execution and property specifications for jpf-android
JPF-Android is a model checking tool for Android applications allowing them to be verified outside of an emulator on Java PathFinder (JPF). The Android applications are executed on a model of the Android software stack and their execution driven by simulating user and system input events. This paper follows from our previous work describing the design decisions and implementation of JPF-Android. Here we discuss the syntax and implementation of the scripting environment which is used to drive the execution of the An- droid application under analysis. It also focuses on a further extension to the tool used to automatically monitor the run- time behavior of Android applications.
