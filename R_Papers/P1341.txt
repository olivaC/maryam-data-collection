A model checker for hierarchical probabilistic real-time systems
Real-life systems are usually hard to control, due to their complicated structures, quantitative time factors and even stochastic behaviors. In this work, we present a model checker to analyze hierarchical probabilistic real-time systems. A modeling language called PRTS is used to specify such systems, and automatic zone-abstraction approach, which is probability preserving, is used to generate finite state MDP. We have implemented PRTS in model checking framework PAT so that friendly user interface can be used to edit, simulate and verify PRTS models. Some experiments are conducted to show our toolâ€™s efficiency.
