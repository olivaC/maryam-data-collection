Identifying and tracking sensitive data
A method of classifying privacy relevance of an application programming interface (API) comprises analyzing a set of input applications to identify a plurality of custom APIs and generating a respective taint specification for each identified custom API. The method further comprises generating taint flows based on each taint specification and matching features and associated feature values from the taint flows to a set of feature templates. The method also comprises correlating the matched features and associated feature values with respective privacy relevance of the plurality of custom APIs to identify a set of privacy relevant features. The method further comprises detecting a candidate API, extracting features from the candidate API and comparing the extracted features to the set of privacy relevant features. Based on the comparison, a label is assigned to the candidate API indicating privacy relevance of the candidate API.
