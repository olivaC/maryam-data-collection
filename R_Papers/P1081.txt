Parameter values of Android APIs: A preliminary study on 100,000 apps
Parameter values are important elements for understanding how Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used in practice. In the context of Android, a few number of API methods are used pervasively by millions of apps, where these API methods provide app core functionality. In this paper, we present preliminary insights from ParamHarver, a purely static analysis approach for automatically extracting parameter values from Android apps. Investigations on 100,000 apps illustrate how an in-depth study of parameter values can be leveraged in various scenarios (e.g., to recommend relevant parameter values, or even, to some extent, to identify malicious apps).
