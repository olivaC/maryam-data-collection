Partitioning of program analyses into sub-analyses using dynamic hints
An exemplary apparatus and computer program product are disclosed which employ a method that includes performing a first static analysis to locate elements within a program and instrumenting the program to enable a subsequent dynamic analysis based on the located elements. The method includes executing the instrumented program and performing during execution analysis to determine individual sets of statements in the program affected by a corresponding element. The method includes partitioning the sets of statements into partitions based on one or more considerations, each partition including one or more of the elements. The method includes performing a second static analysis on the partitions of the program to produce results and outputting the results. The method may be performed for, e.g., security (e.g., taint) analysis, buffer overflow analysis, and typestate analysis.
