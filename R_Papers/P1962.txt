Experimental evaluation of ontology-based test generation for multi-agent systems
Software agents are a promising technology for todayâ€™s complex, distributed systems. Methodologies and techniques that address testing and reliability of multi agent systems are increasingly demanded, in particular to support automated test case generation and execution. A novel approach, based on agent interaction ontology, has been recently proposed and integrated into a testing framework, called eCAT, which can generate and evolve test cases automatically, and run them continuously. In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of an ontology-based test generation approach. We use two BDI agent applications as case studies to investigate the performance of the framework as well as its capability to reveal faults.
