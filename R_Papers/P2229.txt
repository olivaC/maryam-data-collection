Answering security queries statically based on dynamically-determined information
A method includes analyzing execution of a software program, the software program having sources returning values, sinks that perform security-sensitive operations on those returned values or modified versions of the returned values, and flows of the returned values to the sinks, the analyzing determining a first set of methods having access to a value returned from a selected one of the sources. A static analysis is performed on the software program, the static analysis using the first set of methods to determine a second set of methods having calling relationships with the selected source, the static analysis determining whether the returned value from the selected source can flow through a flow to a sink that performs a security-sensitive operation without the flow to the sink being endorsed, and in response, indicating a security violation. Apparatus and computer program products are also disclosed.
