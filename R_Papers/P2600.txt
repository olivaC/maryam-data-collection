Mining the Jazz repository: Challenges and opportunities
By integrating various development and collaboration tools into one single platform, the Jazz environment offers several opportunities for software repository miners. In particular, Jazz offers full traceability from the initial requirements via work packages and work assignments to the final changes and tests; all these features can be easily accessed and leveraged for better prediction and recommendation systems. In this paper, we share our initial experiences from mining the Jazz repository. We also give a short overview of the retrieved data sets and discuss possible problems of the Jazz repository and the platform itself.
