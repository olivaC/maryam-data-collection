Feature location benchmark for software families using eclipse community releases
It is common belief that high impact research in software reuse requires assessment in realistic, non-trivial, comparable, and reproducible settings. However, real software artefacts and common representations are usually unavailable. Also, establishing a representative ground truth is a challenging and debatable subject. Feature location in the context of software families is a research field that is becoming more mature with a high proliferation of techniques. We present EFLBench, a benchmark and a framework to provide a common ground for this field. EFLBench leverages the efforts made by the Eclipse Community which provides real feature-based family artefacts and their implementations. Eclipse is an active and non-trivial project and thus, it establishes an unbiased ground truth. EFLBench is publicly available and supports all tasks for feature location techniques integration, benchmark construction and benchmark usage. We demonstrate its usage and its simplicity and reproducibility by comparing four techniques.
