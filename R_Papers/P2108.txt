After-the-fact configuration of static analysis tools able to reduce user burden
A method includes mapping, based on a first mapping from possible security findings to possible configuration-related sources of imprecision, actual security findings from a static analysis of a program to corresponding configuration-related sources of imprecision, the mapping of the actual security findings creating a second mapping. A user is requested to configure selected ones of the configuration-related sources of imprecision from the second mapping. Responsive to a user updating configuration corresponding to the selected ones of the configuration-related sources of imprecision, security analysis results are updated for the static analysis of the program at least by determining whether one or more security findings from the security analysis results are no longer considered to be vulnerable based on the updated configuration by the user. The updated security analysis results are output. Apparatus and program products are also disclosed.
