Automating regression test selection based on UML designs
This paper presents a methodology and tool to support test selection from regression test suites based on change analysis in object-oriented designs. We assume that designs are represented using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0 and we propose a formal mapping between design changes and a classification of regression test cases into three categories: Reusable, Retestable, and Obsolete. We provide evidence of the feasibility of the methodology and its usefulness by using our prototype tool on an industrial case study and two student projects.
