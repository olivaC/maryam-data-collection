SecureMR: secure mapreduce using homomorphic encryption and program partitioning
In cloud computing customers upload data and computation to cloud providers. As they cede their data to the cloud provider, they may cede data confidentiality. We develop SecureMR, a system that analyzes and transforms MapReduce programs to operate over encrypted data. SecureMR makes use of partially homomorphic encryption and a trusted client. We evaluate SecureMR on a set of MapReduce benchmarks.
