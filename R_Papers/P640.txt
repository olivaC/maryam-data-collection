Client and server verification for web services using interface grammars
Web services provide a promising framework for developing inter- operable software components that interact with each other across organizational boundaries. For this framework to be successful, the client and the server for a service have to interact with each other based on the published service interface specification. If ei- ther the client or the server deviate from the interface specification, the client-server interaction will lead to errors. We present a frame- work for checking interface conformance for web services. Given an interface specification, we automatically generate web service server stubs (for client verification) and drivers (for server verifi- cation) and then use these stubs and drivers to check the confor- mance of the client and server to the interface specification. We implemented this framework by using interface grammars as the interface specification language. We developed an interface com- piler that automatically generates a stub or a driver from a given interface grammar. We conducted a case study by applying these techniques to the Amazon E-Commerce Service.
