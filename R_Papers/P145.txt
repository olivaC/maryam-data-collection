Lifting the curse of stringly-typed code
How often do JavaScript programmers embed structured languages into strings literals? We conduct an empirical investigating mining nearly 500 thousand JavaScript source files from almost ten thousand repositories from GitHub. We parsed each string literal with seven separate common grammars, and found the most common data type that is hidden within the confines of string literals. To reduce the overuse of strings for structured data types, we present a simple static program analyzer that finds embedded languages and warns the developer, providing an optional fix.
