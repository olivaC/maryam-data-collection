Foraging goes mobile: Foraging while debugging on mobile devices
Although Information Foraging Theory (IFT) research for desktop environments has provided important insights into numerous information foraging tasks, we have been unable to locate IFT research for mobile environments. Despite the limits of mobile platforms, mobile apps are increasingly serving functions that were once exclusively the territory of desktops - and as the complexity of mobile apps increases, so does the need for foraging. In this paper we investigate, through a theory-based, dual replication study, whether and how foraging results from a desktop IDE generalize to a functionally similar mobile IDE. Our results show ways prior foraging research results from desktop IDEs generalize to mobile IDEs and ways they do not, and point to challenging open research questions for foraging on mobile environments.
