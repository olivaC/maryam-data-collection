automated compositional verification
Compositional verification presents a divide-and-conquer, thus more scalable approach to verification: it decomposes the verification task for a system into simpler verification problems for individual components of the system. In checking components in isolation, one typically needs to include information about the contexts/environments in which components are expected to operate. Although compositional techniques have been advocated for several decades, there has only recently been a trend towards increasing automation of their application, thus making them more usable in practice.
