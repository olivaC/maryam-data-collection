Automatic classification of security vulnerabilities in computer software applications
Automatically classifying security vulnerabilities in computer software applications by identifying candidate security vulnerabilities in a learning set including at least a first computer software application, classifying each of the candidate security vulnerabilities using predefined classifications, determining, for each of the candidate security vulnerabilities, values for predefined properties, creating a set of correlations between the property values and the classifications of the candidate security vulnerabilities, identifying a candidate security vulnerability in a second computer software application, determining, for the candidate security vulnerability in the second computer software application, values for the predefined properties, and using the set of correlations to classify the candidate security vulnerability in the second computer software application with a classification from the predefined classifications that best correlates with the property values of the candidate security vulnerability in the second computer software application.
