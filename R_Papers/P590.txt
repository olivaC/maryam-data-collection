An integrated data model verifier with property templates
Most modern web applications are built using development frameworks based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. In MVC-based web applications the data model specifies the types of objects used by the application and the relations among them. Since the data model forms the foundation of such applications, its correctness is crucial. In this paper we present a tool, IDAVER, that 1) automatically extracts a formal data model specification from applications implemented using the Ruby on Rails framework, 2) provides templates for specifying data model properties, 3) automatically translates the verification of properties specified using these templates to satisfiability queries in three different logics, and 4) uses automated decision procedures and theorem provers to identify which properties are satisfied by the data model, and 5) reports counterexample instances for the properties that fail. Our tool achieves scalable automated verification by exploiting the modularity in the MVC pattern. IDAVER does not require formal specifications to be written manually; thus, our tool enables automated verification and increases the usability by combining automated data model extraction with template-based property specification.
