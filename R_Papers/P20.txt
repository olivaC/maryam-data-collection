Information flow analysis for go
We present the current state of the art of information flow analyses for Go applications. Based on our findings, we discuss future directions of where static analysis information can be used at runtime to for example achieve higher precision, or optimise runtime checks. We focus specifically on outstanding language features such as closures and message-based communication via channels.
