Security testing of web applications with specialized payloads
In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method for security testing of web applications with specialized payloads includes submitting a test to a web application, where the test includes a payload with a set of constraints. A response is received from the web application. One or more constraints are derived from the response. The set of constraints of the payload are updated with the derived one or more constraints. The payload is synthesized, by a computer processor, for the updated set of constraints. The test having the synthesized payload is iterated with the updated set of constraints.
