Automatic Page Object Generation with APOGEN
Page objects are used in web test automation to decouple the test cases logic from their concrete implementation. Despite the undeniable advantages they bring, as decreasing the maintenance effort of a test suite, yet the burden of their manual development limits their wide adoption. In this demo paper, we give an overview of Apogen, a tool that leverages reverse engineering, clustering and static analysis, to automatically generate Java page objects for web applications.
