Rigorous examination of reactive systems
The goal of the RERS challenge is to evaluate the effectiveness of various verification and validation approaches on reactive systems, a class of systems that is highly relevant for industrial critical applications. The RERS challenge brings together researchers from different areas of software verification and validation, including static analysis, model checking, theorem proving, symbolic execution, and testing. The challenge provides a forum for experimental comparison of different techniques on specifically designed verification tasks. These benchmarks are automatically synthesized to exhibit chosen properties, and then enhanced to include dedicated dimensions of difficulty, such as conceptual complexity of the properties (e.g., reachability, safety, liveness), size of the reactive systems (a few hundred lines to millions of lines), and complexity of language features (arrays and pointer arithmetic). The STTT special section on RERS describes the results of the evaluations and the different analysis techniques that were used in the RERS challenges 2012 and 2013.
