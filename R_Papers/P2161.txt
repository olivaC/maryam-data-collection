Weighted security analysis
A method, computer program product, and system for transforming unit tests is described. A unit test associated with one or more software units is identified. A graphical representation of a portion of a computer program is built, wherein the graphical representation includes a control flow edge. A potentially vulnerable data flow associated with the control flow edge is identified. A control flow weight is assigned to the control flow edge, based upon, at least in part, identifying the potentially vulnerable data flow. A security analysis is applied to the portion of the computer program based upon, at least in part, the control flow weight.
