Mining models
Modern Model Checking techniques can easily verify advanced properties in complex software systems. Specifying these models and properties is as hard as ever, though. I present techniques to extract models from legacy systemsâ€”models that are precise and complete enough to serve as specifications, and which open the door to modular verification.
