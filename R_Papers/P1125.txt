BUT4Reuse Feature identifier: Identifying reusable features on software variants
Software-intensive companies apply software reuse to increase their productivity. However different levels of software reuse exist ranging from ad-hoc reuse such as copy-paste, to systematic software reuse as promoted by Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE). In SPLE, the commonality and variability in the functionalities of a set of product variants is captured by a feature model. Therefore, the feature model captures the reusable features of the scoped products. Companies with existing similar products could increase the productivity and maintainability by achieving this higher levels of reuse. Bottom-Up Technologies for Reuse (BUT4Reuse) tackle the challenging issue of SPL adoption given a set of existing variants. In this paper we present one of BUT4Reuse main functionalities: Identifying features from software variants. The tool integrates and provides new feature identification techniques that could be applied and extended to any kind of software artifacts.
