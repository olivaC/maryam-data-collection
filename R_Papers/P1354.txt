An efficient algorithm for learning event-recording automata
In inference of untimed regular languages, given an unknown language to be inferred, an automaton is constructed to accept the unknown language from answers to a set of membership queries each of which asks whether a string is contained in the unknown language. One of the most well-known regular inference algorithms is the L* algorithm, proposed by Angluin in 1987, which can learn a minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to accept the unknown language. In this work, we propose an efficient polynomial time learning algorithm, TL*, for timed regular language accepted by event-recording automata. Given an unknown timed regular language, TL* first learns a DFA accepting the untimed version of the timed language, and then passively refines the DFA by adding time constraints. We prove the correctness, termination, and minimality of the proposed TL* algorithm.
