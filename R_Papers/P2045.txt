Detecting vulnerability to resource exhaustion
In an aspect of managing resource exhaustion, a method includes receiving a program code that is configured for generating a random number. The generating is identified as vulnerable to a resource exhaustion. The method also includes identifying a statement in the program code at which a value of a variable associated with the generating of the random number is affected, inserting a hooking code in the statement for monitoring the variable at the statement, and running the program code in a plurality of iterations. A consumption level of the resource is varied in the plurality of iterations. The method further includes monitoring a plurality of values of the variable in the plurality of iterations. The method also includes executing a regression analysis on the plurality of values and returning a root cause of the vulnerability.
