Identifying and isolating library code in software applications
A computer system, method, and computer readable product are provided for identifying and isolating library code that has been obfuscated in software applications. A call graph is created for the execution of at least one module of preexisting library code within a bundle of software modules through either static analysis of the software code or dynamic analysis of the executing code, and then one or more anchor points are devised based upon the call graph that are indicative of the preexisting library code. Then a bundle of software modules can be analyzed or its execution monitored to determine if a discrete module of library code is present in the executing bundle based upon the modules' interaction with the one or more anchor points, and the discrete module of library code in the executing bundle can be identified as a module of preexisting library code.
