O! Snap: Cost-Efficient Testing in the Cloud
Porting a testing environment to a cloud infrastructure is not straightforward. This paper presents O!Snap, an approach to generate test plans to cost-efficiently execute tests in the cloud. O!Snap automatically maximizes reuse of existing virtual machines, and interleaves the creation of updated test images with the execution of tests to minimize overall test execution time and/or cost. In an evaluation involving 2,600+ packages and 24,900+ test jobs of the Debian continuous integration environment, O!Snap reduces test setup time by up to 88% and test execution time by up to 43.3% without additional costs.
