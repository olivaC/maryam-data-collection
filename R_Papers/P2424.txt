SPAS: scalable path-sensitive pointer analysis on full-sparse SSA
We present a new SPAS (Scalable PAth-Sensitive) framework for resolving points-to sets in C programs that exploits recent advances in pointer analysis. SPAS enables intraprocedural path-sensitivity to be obtained in flow-sensitive and context-sensitive (FSCS) techniques scalably, by using BDDs to manipulate program paths and by performing pointer analysis level-by-level on a full-sparse SSA representation similarly as the state-of-the-art LevPA (the FSCS version of SPAS). Compared with LevPA using all 27 C benchmarks in SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006, SPAS incurs 18.42% increase in analysis time and 10.97% increase in memory usage on average, while guaranteeing that all points-to sets are obtained with non-decreasing precision.
