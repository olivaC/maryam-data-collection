A method of generating a summarized ontology includes loading an ontology from a store, eliminating relationships in the ontology, the eliminating relationships including an insertion of new relationships that simplify the ontology, eliminating individuals in the ontology, the eliminating individuals including insertion of new individuals to simplify the ontology, eliminating concepts in the ontology including insertion of new concepts to simplify the ontology, and generating the summarized ontology from the eliminating relationships, eliminating individuals and eliminating concepts.
