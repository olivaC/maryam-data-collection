Identifying security vulnerability in computer software
Identifying a security vulnerability in a computer software application by identifying at least one source in a computer software application, identifying at least one sink in the computer software application, identifying at least one input to any of the sinks, determining whether the input derives its value directly or indirectly from any of the sources, determining a set of possible values for the input, and identifying a security vulnerability where the set of possible values for the input does not match a predefined specification of legal values associated with the sink input.
