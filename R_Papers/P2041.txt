Detection of antipatterns through statistical analysis
A computer implemented method of detecting code antipatterns, comprising: 1) Receiving a code containing one or more of a plurality of code segments, each one of the one or more code segments includes one or more of a plurality of patterns. 2) Automatically analyzing each one of the one or more code segment to create an array of a plurality of features vectors, each one of the plurality of features vectors maps a plurality of predefined features found in one or more patterns. 3) Matching each one of the plurality of features vectors with a plurality of template features vectors each representing one of a plurality of antipatterns, the plurality of template features vectors is stored in an antipatterns dataset. 4) Determining a presence or an absence of each of the plurality of antipatterns within each of the one or more code segments according to the matching.
