Measuring robustness of web services to denial of service attacks
A method for measuring robustness of web services includes selecting a web-service method for testing. The request pattern with the slowest response by the web-service method from a series of request patterns is selected as a request pattern for testing. The series of request patterns includes irregular requests, each having a payload aimed at destabilizing the web service. A test is applied to the web-service method, using the selected request pattern applied at an increasing frequency to the web-service method. The response time of the request pattern is monitored by the web-service method. The frequency of the applied request pattern when a threshold maximum time for response of the web-service method to the request pattern is reached, or when the method fails, is determined by a computer processor. A metric is determined for the web-service method based on the frequency of the applied request pattern required to reach the threshold.
