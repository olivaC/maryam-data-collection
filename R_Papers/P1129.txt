The NOAH project: Giving a chance to threatened species in Africa with UAVs
Organized crime now targets one of the most precious wealth in Africa, the wild life. The most affected by the poaching are the Big 5, whose survival requires attention and efforts from everyone, in accordance to his own expertise. Just as Noah (A patriarchal character in Abrahamic religions) was tasked to save every species from the Genesis flood, we envision the NOAH Project to (re)make natural parks as a safe haven. This endeavor requires efficient and effective surveillance which is now facilitated by the use of UAVs. We take this approach further by proposing the use of ICT algorithms to automate surveillance. The proposed intelligent system could inspect a bigger area, recognize potential threats and be manage by non-expert users, reducing the expensive resources that are needed by developing countries to address the problem.
