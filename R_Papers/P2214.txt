Static analysis of computer software applications having a model-view-controller architecture
Preparing a computer software application for static analysis by identifying a control flow within a model portion of a computer software application having a model-view-controller architecture, where the control flow passes a value to a controller portion of the computer software application, analyzing a declarative specification of the controller portion of the computer software application to identify a view to which the controller portion passes control based on the value, and synthesizing a method within the computer software application, where the method calls the view.
