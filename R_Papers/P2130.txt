Optimizing test data payload selection for testing computer software applications via computer networks
Testing a computer software application by configuring a first computer to execute a copy of data-checking software used by a computer software application at a second computer, processing a first copy of a test data payload using the data-checking software at the first computer, where the test data payload is configured to test for an associated security vulnerability, determining that the first copy of the test data payload is endorsed by the data-checking software at the first computer for further processing, and sending a second copy of the test data payload via a computer network to the computer software application at the second computer for processing threat.
