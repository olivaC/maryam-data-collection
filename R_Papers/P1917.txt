Bpmn visual rule language for business process aspectization
Beyond the process workflow itself, business processes usually involve several other concerns, often scattered across the whole process and tangled with the main view. Though allowing to represent classic process perspectives, existing business process modelling languages do not provide any constructs to describe these concerns. We consider the use of aspects to cope with this lacking capacity of process languages. An aspect is a module that encapsulates a secondary behaviour (e.g, the exception handling) of a main view (e.g., the “happy path” of a process flow), thus allowing designers to manipulate it independently from the main view. For the definition of aspects in BPMN processes, we propose a visual language extending the BPMN with rules allowing the realization of aspect-oriented mechanisms..
