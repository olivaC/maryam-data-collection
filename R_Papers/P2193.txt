Method and apparatus for paralleling and distributing static source code security analysis using loose synchronization
A method of static source code analysis is provided. A forward search of source code is performed from each of a plurality of source nodes. A backward search of source code is performed from each of a plurality of sink nodes, wherein the forward search and the backward search are performed in parallel simultaneously. The progress of the forward search and the backward search are monitored to determine if the searches intersect at a common node. A vulnerability alert is generated when the monitoring determines that a forward search and a backward search reach a common node.
