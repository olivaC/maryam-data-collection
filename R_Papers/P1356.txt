Model-based Methods for Linking Web Service Choreography and Orchestration
In recent years, many Web service composition languages have been proposed. Web service choreography describes collaboration protocols of cooperating Web service participants from a global view. Web service orchestration describes collaboration of the Web services in predefined patterns based on local decision about their interactions with one another at the message/execution level. In this work, we present model-based methods to close the gap between the two views. Building on the strength of model checking techniques, Web service choreography and orchestration are verified against temporal properties or against each other (to show that they are consistent). Specialized optimization techniques are developed to handle large Web service models. Furthermore, we propose a method to mechanically synthesize a prototype Web service orchestration from choreography, by repairing the choreography if necessary and projecting relevant behaviors to each service provider.
