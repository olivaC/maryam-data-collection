Reuse-aware modulo scheduling for stream processors
This paper presents reuse-aware modulo scheduling to maximizing stream reuse and improving concurrency for stream-level loops running on stream processors. The novelty lies in the development of a new representation for an unrolled and software-pipelined stream-level loop using a set of reuse equations, resulting in simultaneous optimization of two performance objectives for the loop, reuse and concurrency, in a unified framework. We have implemented this work in the compiler developed for our 64-bit FT64 stream processor. Our experimental results obtained on FT64 and by simulation using nine representative stream applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
