Model-based automated and guided configuration of embedded software systems
Configuring Integrated Control Systems (ICSs) is largely manual, time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a model-based configuration approach that interactively guides engineers to configure software embedded in ICSs. Our approach verifies engineersâ€™ decisions at each configuration iteration, and further, automates some of the decisions. We use a constraint solver, SICStus Prolog, to automatically infer configuration decisions and to ensure the consistency of configuration data. We evaluated our approach by applying it to a real subsea oil production system. Specifically, we rebuilt a number of existing verified product configurations of our industry partner. Our experience shows that our approach successfully enforces consistency of configurations, can automatically infer up to 50% of the configuration decisions, and reduces the complexity of making configuration decisions.
