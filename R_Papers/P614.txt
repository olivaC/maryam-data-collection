Analyzing ruby on rails data models using alloy
In this paper we demonstrate that data models in web applications implemented using the Ruby on Rails framework can be automatically analyzed using bounded verification techniques. In particular, we implemented an automatic translator from Ruby on Rails data models to the input language of Alloy, a SAT-based bounded verification tool. Alloy verifies assertions about object oriented data models by exhaustively exploring all possible configurations of the data model within a given scope. We experimented on two open source web applications to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
