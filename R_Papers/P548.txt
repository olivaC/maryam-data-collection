A systematic review of the application and empirical investigation of evolutionary testing
Metaheuristic search techniques have been extensively used to automate the process of generating test cases and thus providing solutions for a more cost-effective testing process. This approach to test automation, often coined as “Evolutionary Testing” (ET), has been used for a wide variety of test case generation purposes, differing in terms of test objectives, test levels, and other characteristics. Since ET techniques are heuristic by nature, they must be empirically investigated in terms of how costly and effective they are at reaching their test objectives and whether they scale up to realistic development artifacts. However, approaches to empirically study ET techniques have shown wide variation in the literature. This paper presents the results of a systematic, comprehensive review that aims at characterizing how empirical studies have been designed to investigate ET cost-effectiveness and what empirical evidence is available in the literature regarding ET cost-effectiveness and scalability. We also provide a framework that drives the data collection process of this systematic review and can be the starting point of guidelines on how ET techniques can be empirically assessed.
