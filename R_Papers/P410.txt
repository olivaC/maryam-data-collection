Revisiting model-driven engineering for run-time verification of business processes
Run-time verification has been widely advocated in the last decade as a key technique to check whether the execution of a business process and its interactions with partner services comply with the application requirements. Despite the substantial research performed in this area, there are very few approaches that leverage model-driven engineering (MDE) methodologies and integrate them in the development process of applications based on business process descriptions. In this position paper we describe our vision and present the research roadmap for adopting MDE techniques in the context of run-time verification of business processes, based on our early experience with a public service partner in the domain of eGovernment. We maintain that within this context, the adoption of MDE would contribute in three ways: 1) expressing, at a logical level, complex properties to be checked at run time using a domain-specific language; 2) transforming such properties in a format that can leverage state-of-the-art, industrial-strength tools in order to check these properties; 3) integrating such property checker in run-time verification engines, specific to a target run-time platform, without userâ€™s intervention.
