Incremental static analysis
A system, method and computer program product for incremental static analysis, including a change impact analyzer for identifying a changed portion of a computer software (e.g., an application), where the changed portion was changed subsequent to performing a static analysis on the application, a static analysis result invalidator for invalidating any static analysis result that is dependent on the changed portion, and an incremental static analyzer for performing a first incremental static analysis on at least the changed portion, presenting the results of the first incremental static analysis, receiving a request to provide additional information regarding a selected result of the first incremental static analysis, performing, responsive to receiving the request, a second incremental static analysis on any portion of the application to gather the additional information, and presenting results of the second incremental static analysis, thereby providing the additional information regarding the selected result of the first incremental static analysis.
