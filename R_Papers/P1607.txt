CORAL: solving complex constraints for symbolic pathfinder
Symbolic execution is a powerful automated technique for generating test cases. Its goal is to achieve high coverage of software. One major obstacle in adopting the technique in practice is its inability to handle complex mathematical constraints. To address the problem, we have integrated CORAL’s heuristic solvers into NASA Ames’ Symbolic PathFinder symbolic execution tool. CORAL’s solvers have been designed to deal with mathematical constraints and their heuristics have been improved based on examples from the aerospace domain. This integration significantly broadens the application of Symbolic PathFinder at NASA and in industry.
