Software analytics: so what?
The guest editors of this special issue of IEEE Software invited submissions that reflected the benefits (and drawbacks) of software analytics, an area of explosive growth. They had so many excellent submissions that they had to split this special issue into two volumes--you'll see even more content in the September/October issue. They divided the articles on conceptual grounds, so both volumes will feature equally excellent work. The Web extra at http://youtu.be/nO6X0azR0nw is a video interview in which IEEE Software editor in chief Forrest Shull speaks with Tim Menzies about the growing importance of software analytics.
