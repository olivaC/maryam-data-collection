AndroZoo++: Collecting Millions of Android Apps and Their Metadata for the Research Community
We present a growing collection of Android apps collected from several sources, including the official Google Play app market and a growing collection of various metadata of those collected apps aiming at facilitating the Android-relevant research works. Our dataset by far has collected over five million apps and over 20 types of metadata such as VirusTotal reports. Our objective of collecting this dataset is to contribute to ongoing research efforts, as well as to enable new potential research topics on Android Apps. By releasing our app and metadata set to the research community, we also aim at encouraging our fellow researchers to engage in reproducible experiments. This article will be continuously updated based on the growing apps and metadata collected in the AndroZoo project. If you have specific metadata that you want to collect from AndroZoo and which are not yet provided by far, please let us know. We will thereby prioritise it in our collecting process so as to provide it to our fellow researchers in a short manner.
