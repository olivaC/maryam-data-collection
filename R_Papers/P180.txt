Oral Communication: Generating Network Data for Automated Unit Test Generation
Although automated unit test generation techniques can in principle generate test suites that achieve high code coverage, in practice this is often inhibited by the dependence of the code under test on external resources. In particular, a common problem in modern programming languages is posed by code that involves networking (e.g., opening a TCP listening port). In order to generate tests for such code, we describe an approach where we mock (simulate) the networking interfaces of the Java standard library, such that a search-based test generator can treat the network as part of the test input space.
