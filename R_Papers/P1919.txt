Summary form only given. Search based software engineering is not necessarily going to replace existing heuristics and solutions to software engineering problems. In fact, the search based framework is flexible enough to allow for smooth integration with several of the existing techniques. Hence, hybridization of search based algorithms with available methods has the potential of a win-win alliance, where the strengths of the various approaches get amplified by the union. Future research in search based software engineering should investigate in depth the challenging opportunities offered by such hybridization.
