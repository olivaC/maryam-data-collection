Method and system for performance profiling of software
Performance profiling of software by producing a performance profile of a software processing unit and performing statistical analysis on the performance profile by matching the performance profile with at least one additional performance profile. An algorithmic approach is used to match data related to processes and/or threads and/or similar processing units (PU) over multiple performance profiles. One purpose of the matching algorithm is to identify such PU in order to enable computation of an accumulated or averaged dataset over multiple profiling periods. Various matching strategies, filters, and preprocessing techniques are described, together with level of reliability estimation.
