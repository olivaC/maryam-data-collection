Differential static program analysis
Systems for program analysis include a high-level scanning tool configured to perform a high-level analysis on a program using a processor to generate one or more high-level findings; one or more low-level scanning tools, each configured to perform a low-level analysis on the program using a processor to generate a low-level finding; and a mapping module configured to map the one or more low-level findings to the high-level findings to generate a concise combination report that categorizes each finding according to the highest-level analysis that produces the finding
