Enhanced String Analysis that Improves Accuracy of Static Analysis
An apparatus and computer program product which are configured for determining, as part of a static analysis of a program, links between functions in the program and performing, as part of the static analysis, string analysis on strings used in the program to determine additional links between the functions in the program. The apparatus and computer program product are further configured for outputting, as part of the static analysis, indications of at least the links between the functions and the additional links between the functions.
