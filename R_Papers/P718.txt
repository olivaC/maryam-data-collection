Optimizing sparse schema-less data in relational stores
Various embodiments of the invention relate to optimizing storage of schema-less data. A schema-less dataset including a plurality of resources is received. Each resource is associated with at least a plurality of properties. At least one set of co-occurring properties from the plurality of properties is identified. A graph including a plurality of nodes is generated. Each of the nodes represents a unique property in the set of co-occurring properties. The graph further includes an edge connecting each node representing a pair of co-occurring properties. A graph coloring operation is performed on the graph. The graph coloring operation includes assigning each of nodes to a color, where nodes connected by an edge are assigned different colors. A schema is generated that assigns a column identifier from a table to each unique property represented by one of the nodes in the graph based on the color assigned to the node.
