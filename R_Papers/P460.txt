A modeling approach to support the similarity-based reuse of configuration data
Product configuration in families of Integrated Control Systems (ICSs) involves resolving thousands of configurable parameters and is, therefore, time-consuming and error-prone. Typically, these systems consist of highly similar components that need to be configured similarly. For large-scale systems, a considerable portion of the configuration data can be reused, based on such similarities, during the configuration of each individual product. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to automate the reuse of configuration data based on the similarities within an ICS product. Our approach enables configuration engineers to manipulate the reuse of configuration data, and ensures the consistency of the reused data. Evaluation of the approach, using a number of configured products from an industry partner, shows that more than 60% of configuration data can be automatically reused using our similarity-based approach, thereby reducing configuration effort.
