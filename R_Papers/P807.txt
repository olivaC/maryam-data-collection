Flexible and secure clickjacking protection mechanism
Methods, systems, and computer-readable storage media for preventing a clickjacking attack on a web page. Implementations include inhibiting rendering of content of the web page, receiving a message from an embedding web page, the embedding web page having called the web page, the message including metadata, and determining whether the embedding web page is trusted based on the metadata, wherein rendering of content of the web page remains inhibited if the embedding web page is untrusted, and rendering of content of the web page is executed if the embedding web page is trusted.
