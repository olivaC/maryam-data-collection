Towards Exhaustive Testing of Websites using JPF
In this paper, we present a framework for exhaustive test input generation and execution of tests for websites using JPF, and Java libraries such as Selenium and JUnit. Specifically, we utilize the core functionality of jpf-nhandler, a JPF extension, to enable use of useful Java libraries such as GSON in the JPF environment. The paper further describes iterating through webpages successively and generating test inputs systematically for each page. It also presents the experimental results of running our framework on a small example website and a real-world website
