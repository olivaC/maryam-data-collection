Androzoo: Collecting millions of android apps for the research community
We present a growing collection of Android Applications collected from several sources, including the official Google Play app market. Our dataset, AndroZoo, currently contains more than three million apps, each of which has been analysed by tens of different Antivirus products to know which applications are detected as Malware. We provide this dataset to contribute to ongoing research efforts, as well as to enable new potential research topics on Android Apps. By releasing our dataset to the research community, we also aim at encouraging our fellow researchers to engage in reproducible experiments.
