The Browser as a Platform
The browser is the single, most valuable tool for enabling users to access the Web. Browser vendors realize this, which is why domination in the browser market share has been a high-stakes game since the 1990s. In this chapter, we take a look at how browsers can be found on numerous devices today, including mobile devices and smart appliances. We investigate how the browser evolved from a static rendering engine into a full-featured Web application platform, offering Web applications access to local storage facilities, sensor information, communication mechanisms, and more. Finally, we discuss Firefox OS and Googleâ€™s Chrome OS that have given the browser the status of an operating system.
