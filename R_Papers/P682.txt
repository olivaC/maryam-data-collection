Install-Time Security Analysis of Mobile Applications
Online security analysis is provided by installing an analysis agent on a mobile device. The analysis agent monitors the mobile device to detect an initiation of installation for a new application that is to be installed on the mobile device. In response to the initiation of installation, the analysis agent quarantines a set of resources corresponding to the new application; analyzes the set of resources to determine whether or not at least one of a potential security threat or a security misconfiguration exists; and, in response to determining that at least one of the potential security threat or the security misconfiguration exists, generates an alert for informing a user that the potential security threat or the security misconfiguration exists.
