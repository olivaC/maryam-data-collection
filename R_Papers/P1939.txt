Dynamic aspect mining
Legacy systems often contain several crosscutting concerns that could potentially benefit from an aspect-oriented programming implementation. In this paper, we focus on the problem of aspect identification in existing code. The main idea is that use-cases can be defined in order to separate the base logics from the crosscutting concerns to be aspectised. The relationship between the execution traces associated with the use-cases and the executed computational units (class methods) is analysed through concept analysis. The results obtained on some case studies are discussed in the paper.
