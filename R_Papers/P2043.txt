Comparing webpage elements having asynchronous functionality
Techniques for determining differences between document object models (DOMs) received in response to asynchronous functionality calls is described herein. The techniques may include clustering elements in a webpage having asynchronous functionality. The techniques include executing asynchronous functionality calls for two of the elements that form a cluster, and receiving a document object model (DOM) in response to each of the asynchronous functionality calls. The DOMs are compared to determine whether a difference exists between the DOMs based on a predetermined threshold. If no difference exists, execution of the asynchronous functionality calls is ceased.
