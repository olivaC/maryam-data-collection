Name suggestions during feature identification: the variclouds approach
Reengineering a Software Product Line from legacy variants remains a challenging endeavour. Among various challenges, it is a complex task to retrieve enough information for inferring the variability from experts' domain knowledge and from the semantics of software elements. We propose the VariClouds process that can be leveraged by domain experts to understand the semantics behind the different blocks identified during software variants analysis. VariClouds is based on interactive word cloud visualisations providing name suggestions for these blocks using tf-idf as weighting factor. We evaluate our approach by assessing its added-value to several previous works in the literature where no tool support was provided to domain experts to characterise features from software blocks.
