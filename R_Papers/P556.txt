State Space Exploration
In this chapter we provide a basic survey of reachability analysis for verification of string manipulating programs starting with explicit state enumeration. We discuss both forward and backward reachability analysis using depth-first search where states of a given string manipulating program are traversed one state at a time. Next, we discuss symbolic reachability analysis, where the basic idea is to perform state exploration using sets of states rather than traversing states one by one. We discuss that reachability analysis corresponds to fixpoint computations, and, in order to develop a symbolic analysis framework for string manipulating programs, we need to first develop a symbolic representation that can represent sets of strings.
