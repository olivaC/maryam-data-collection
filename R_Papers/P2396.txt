EMI filter design and optimization for both AC and DC side in a DC-fed motor drive system
This paper proposes an EMI filter design and optimization method for both AC and DC side in a DC-fed motor drive system. Based on the noise generation and propagation mechanism, the analysis of common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) EMI noise equivalent circuits is provided. Based on those equivalent circuits, this paper investigates the system EMI noise between AC and DC side, which shows the interaction between DM and CM noises and the interaction between adding AC and DC side filters. With these considerations, an optimized EMI filter design procedure is proposed to design CM and DM filters for both AC and DC sides. To minimize the impact on the EMI noise of one side caused by adding filter on the other side, certain order must be followed to design AC and DC CM and DM filters. Moreover, the EMI filter weight optimization method is also discussed to get the minimum weight of EMI filter and improve system power density. Simulation and experimental results verify the interaction between AC and DC filters and show that EMI filters can be designed to suppress both AC and DC EMI noise to meet the standard with the proposed EMI filter design method.
