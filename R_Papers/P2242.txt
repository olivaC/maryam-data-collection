Injection context based static analysis of computer software applications
Embodiments of the invention generally relate to injection context based static analysis of computer software applications. Embodiments of the invention may include selecting a sink within a computer software application, tracing a character output stream leading to the sink within the computer software application, determining an injection context of the character output stream at the sink, where the injection context is predefined in association with a state of the character output stream at the sink, identifying any actions that have been predefined in association with the identified injection context, and providing a report of the actions.
