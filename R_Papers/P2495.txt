Programmers should still use slices when debugging
What is the best technique for fault localization? In a study of 37 real bugs (and 37 injected faults) in more than a dozen open source C programs, we compare the effectiveness of statistical debugging against dynamic slicingâ€”the first study ever to compare the techniques. On average, dynamic slicing is more effective than statistical debugging, requiring programmers to examine only 14% (42 lines) of the code before finding the defect, less than half the effort required by statistical debugging (30% or 157 lines). Best results are obtained by a hybrid approach: If programmers first examine the top five most suspicious locations from statistical debugging, and then switch to dynamic slices, they will need to examine only 11% (35 lines) of the code.
