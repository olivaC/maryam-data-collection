System testing of timing requirements based on use cases and timed automata
In the context of use-case centric development and requirements-driven testing, this paper addresses the problem of automatically deriving system test cases to verify timing requirements. Inspired by engineering practice in an automotive software development context, we rely on an analyzable form of use case specifications and augment such functional descriptions with timed automata, capturing timing requirements, following a methodology aiming at minimizing modeling overhead. We automate the generation of executable test cases using a test strategy based on maximizing test suite diversity and building over the UPPAAL model checker. Initial empirical results based on an industrial case study provide evidence of the effectiveness of the approach.
