An empirical evaluation of visualisation in software design modelling: the VCL vs UML+ OCL experiment
Popular notations of software and systems engineering, such as the standards UML and SysML, have an intrinsic visual nature, enabling them to tap into the cognitive benefits that visual representations are know to provide. However, these widespread notations fail to exploit the full cognitive potential of visual representations; despite their visual appeal, they fail to be cognitive effective. The Visual Contract Language (VCL) tries to improve the visual effectiveness and level of rigour of popular visual notations of software and systems design; it tries to fully exploit the cognitive potential of visual representations and increase the range of things that can be described visually. VCL embodies a diagrammatic modelling approach that does pictorially what is traditionally done textually. This report presents the work that was undertaken to rigorously evaluate VCL. It presents the design of a controlled experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of VCL together with the results of the experiment. The experiment compares VCL against UML supplemented with OCL, which are widely seen as industry standards.
