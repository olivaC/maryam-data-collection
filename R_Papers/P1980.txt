Synthesis of security exploits via self-amplifying deep learning
Techniques for synthesizing security exploits via self-amplifying deep learning are provided. In one example, a computer-implemented method can comprise generating, by a system operatively coupled to a processor, a probabilistic model based on an evaluation of one or more first payloads included in a first group of payloads. The computer implemented method can also comprise determining, by the system, based on the probabilistic model, that at least one first payload from the first group of payloads is invalid. Additionally, the computer implemented method can comprise, generating, by the system, a second group of payloads based on removing the at least one invalid first payload from the first group of payloads
