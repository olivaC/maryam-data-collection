Incremental compositional dynamic test generation
Concepts and technologies are described herein for incremental compositional dynamic test generation. The concepts and technologies described herein are used to increase the code coverage and security vulnerability identification abilities of testing applications and devices, without significantly increasing, and in some cases decreasing, computational and time costs associated with the testing. Test summaries that describe how code is tested by a test engine are generated and stored during testing of code. These test summaries can be evaluated when additional iterations or versions of the code are tested. If functions corresponding to the test summaries are unchanged from, or logically equivalent to, a version of the function previously tested, the test summary may be used when testing the new version of the code.
