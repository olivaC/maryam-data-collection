Kodu language and grammar specification
We describe the language of Kodu using a grammar based on the notation for context-free grammars. This language specification should serve as a reference for researchers and teachers who seek to learn or study Kodu as a language. To make these resources more accessible to a broader audience, we have generated two different language descriptions. The first is a basic language description, which provides the general structure and syntax of a Kodu program. The second is an extension of the basic language that contains all the constructs implemented in the Kodu language.
