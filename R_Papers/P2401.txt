Mathematical Background
In this chapter the basic background of the mathematical methods applied throughout this thesis is described. Since the classical least-squares (LS) adjustment method has been widely used in GPS data processing, Sect. 2.1 outlines the concept of LS parameter estimation in linear models. Afterwards, some fundamental ideas behind time series analysis are presented in Sect. 2.2. Of particular importance are the so-called autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes which hold great potential for modelling the temporal correlation behaviour of GPS observation noise. Section 2.3 summarises the core characteristics as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the employed statistical hypothesis tests. In view of practical applications, Appendix A provides the quantiles of the distributions of the test statistics for usual significance levels. Finally, Sect. 2.4 gives a brief introduction to wavelet transforms, serving within the framework of this thesis as a time-frequency analysis tool for the visual verification of the residual-based temporal correlation modelling presented in Chaps. 7 and 8.
