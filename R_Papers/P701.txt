Method and apparatus for identifying the optimal schema to store graph data in a relational store
A system for identifying a schema for storing graph data includes a database containing a graph dataset of data and relationships between data pairs and a list of storage methods that each are a distinct structural arrangement of the data and relationships from the graph data set. An analyzer module collects statistics for the graph dataset, and a data classification module uses the collected statistics to calculate metrics describing the data and relationships in the graph dataset, uses the calculated metrics to group the data and relationships into a plurality of graph dataset subsets and. associates each graph dataset subset with one of the plurality of storage methods. The resulting group of storage methods associated with the plurality of graph dataset subsets includes a unique storage method for each graph dataset subset. The data and relationships in each graph dataset subset are arranged in accordance with associated storage methods.
