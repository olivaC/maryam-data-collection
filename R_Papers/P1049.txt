Towards a Plug-and-Play and Holistic Data Mining Framework for Understanding and Facilitating Operations in Smart Buildings
Nowadays, a significant portion of the total energy consumption is attributed to the buildings sector. In order to save energy and protect the environment, energy consumption in buildings must be more efficient. At the same time, buildings should offer the same (if not more) comfort to their occupants. Consequently, modern buildings have been equipped with various sensors and actuators and interconnected control systems to meet occupantsâ€™ requirements. Unfortunately, so far, Building Automation Systems data have not been well-exploited due to technical and cost limitations. Yet, it can be exceptionally beneficial to take full advantage of the data flowing inside buildings in order to diagnose issues, explore solutions and improve occupant-building interactions. This paper presents a plug-and-play and holistic data mining framework named PHoliData for smart buildings to collect, store, visualize and mine useful information and domain knowledge from data in smart buildings. PHoliData allows non technical experts to easily explore and understand their buildings with minimum IT support. An architecture of this framework has been introduced and a prototype has been implemented and tested against real-world settings. Discussions with industry experts have suggested the system to be extremely helpful for understanding buildings, since it can provide hints about energy efficiency improvements. Finally, extensive experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of such a framework in practice and its advantage and potential for buildings operators.
