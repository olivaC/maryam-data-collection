Cresco: Construction of evidence repositories for managing standards compliance
We describe CRESCO, a tool for Construction of Evidence REpositories for Managing Standards COmpliance. CRESCO draws on Model Driven Engineering (MDE) technologies to generate a database repository schema from the evidence requirements of a given standard, expressed as a UML class diagram. CRESCO in addition generates a web-based user interface for building and manipulating evidence repositories based on the schema. CRESCO is targeted primarily at addressing the tool infrastructure needs for supporting the collection and management of safety evidence data. A systematic treatment of evidence information is a key prerequisite for demonstration of compliance to safety standards, such as IEC 61508, during the safety certification process.
