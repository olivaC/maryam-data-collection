Advances in model-driven security
Sound methodologies for constructing security-critical systems are extremely important in order to confront the increasingly varied security threats. As a response to this need, Model-Driven Security has emerged in the early 2000s as a specialized Model-Driven Engineering approach for supporting the development of security-critical systems. In this chapter we summarize the most important developments of Model-Driven Security during the past decade. In order to do so we start by building a taxonomy of the most important concepts of this domain. We then use our taxonomy to describe and evaluate a set of representative and influential Model-Driven Security approaches in the literature. In our development of this topic we concentrate on the concepts shared by Model-Driven Engineering and Model-Driven Security. This allows us to identify and debate the advantages, disadvantages, and open issues when applying Model-Driven Engineering to the Information Security domain. This chapter provides a broad view of Model-Driven Security and is intended as an introduction to Model-Driven Security for students, researchers, and practitioners
