Searching code by specifying its behavior
Systems and methods are disclosed for receiving a first specification that identifies program code behavior associated with a plurality of documents. The specification includes an input-output pair with a first data entity and a second data entity. The systems and methods further include identifying one or more documents, within the plurality of documents, that are configured to (i) use at least a portion of the first data entity as an input to program code associated with particular ones of the documents, and (ii) provide at least a portion of the second data entity as output associated with the program code, wherein the particular ones of the documents correspond to a positive matching between one or more constraints associated with each document and one or more constraints associated with the specification, and generating search results comprising the identified one or more documents.
