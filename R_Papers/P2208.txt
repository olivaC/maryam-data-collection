Using a heuristically-generated policy to dynamically select string analysis algorithms for client queries
A method for dynamically selecting string analysis algorithms can begin with the training of the dynamic string analysis handler of a string analysis module to effectively handle a subset of string queries having contextual metadata received from a client application in an instructional environment. The effectiveness of the training module can be based upon feedback from the client application. Upon completion of the training, a string analysis algorithm selection policy can be synthesized. The string analysis algorithm selection policy can correlate a context of a string query in the subset to the usage of a string analysis algorithm. When in the operational environment, the dynamic string analysis handler can dynamically handle string queries having contextual metadata received from the client application in accordance with the string analysis algorithm selection policy. The string analysis algorithm to be used for a string query can be dynamically and independently determined.
