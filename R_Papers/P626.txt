Generating interface grammars from WSDL for automated verification of web services
Interface grammars are a formalism for expressing constraints on sequences of messages exchanged between two components. In this paper, we extend interface grammars with an automated translation of XML Schema definitions present in WSDL documents into interface grammar rules. Given an interface grammar, we can then automatically generate either 1 a parser, to check that a sequence of messages generated by a web service client is correct with respect to the interface specification, or 2) a sentence generator producing compliant message sequences, to check that the web service responds to them according to the interface specification. By doing so, we can validate and generate both messages and sequences of messages in a uniform manner; moreover, we can express constraints where message structure and control flow cannot be handled separately.
