Comparison between different descriptions of a web service
In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method for comparing first and second descriptions of a web service includes computing a distance between each type used as a parameter in the first description and each type used as a parameter in the second description. A distance is calculated between methods in each of two or more pairs of methods. Each pair includes a method in the first description and a method in the second description. The calculating is performed by comparing the parameters of the first set of methods and the second set of methods using the computed distances between types. To the calculated distance between each pair of methods is added the distance between the names of the compared methods and the distance between the returned types of the compared methods. For each method in the first description, the method in the second description with the lowest calculated distance is output.
