Remote entrusting by run-time software authentication
The problem of software integrity is traditionally addressed as the static verification of the code before the execution, often by checking the code signature. However, there are no well-defined solutions to the run-time verification of code integrity when the code is executed remotely, which is refer to as run-time remote entrusting. In this paper we present the research challenges involved in run-time remote entrusting and how we intend to solve this problem. Specifically, we address the problem of ensuring that a given piece of code executes on an remote untrusted machine and that its functionalities have not been tampered with both before execution and during run-time.
