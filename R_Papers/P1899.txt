Semantics-based aspect-oriented management of exceptional flows in business processes
Enriching business process models with semantic annotations that are taken from an ontology has become a crucial need in service provisioning, integration and composition, and business processes management. We represent semantically annotated business processes as part of an Web ontology lanuage knowledge base that formalizes the business process structure, the business domain, a set of criteria that describe correct semantic annotations, and a set of constraints that describe requirements on the business process itself. In this paper, we show how the Semantic Web representation and reasoning techniques can be 1) exploited by our aspect-oriented approach to modularize exception-handling (as well as other crosscutting) mechanisms and 2) effectively applied to formalize and automatically verify constraints on the management of exceptional flows (as well as other relevant flows) in business processes. The benefits of the Semantic Web and the aspect-oriented technologies are illustrated in a case study, where exceptional flows are modularized separately and managed at the semantic level due to the proposed approach.
