Algorizmi: A configurable virtual testbed to generate datasets for offline evaluation of intrusion detection systems
Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are an important security measure that network administrators adopt to defend computer networks against malicious attacks and intrusions. The field of IDS research includes many challenges. However, one open problem remains orthogonal to the others: IDS evaluation. In other words, researchers have not yet succeeded to agree on a general systematic methodology and/or a set of metrics to fairly evaluate different IDS algorithms. This leads to another problem: the lack of an appropriate IDS evaluation dataset that satisfies the common research needs. One major contribution in this area is the DARPA dataset offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Lab (MIT/LL), which has been extensively used to evaluate a number of IDS algorithms proposed in the literature.
