Veriws: a tool for verification of combined functional and non-functional requirements of web service composition
Web service composition is an emerging technique to develop Web applications by composing existing Web services. Web service composition is subject to two important classes of requirements, i.e., functional and non-functional requirements. Both are crucial to Web service composition. Therefore, it is desirable to verify combined functional and non-functional requirements for Web service composition. We present VeriWS, a tool to verify combined functional and non-functional requirements of Web service composition. VeriWS captures the semantics of Web service composition and verifies it directly based on the semantics. We also show how to describe Web service composition and properties using VeriWS. The YouTube video for demonstration of VeriWS is available at https://sites. google.com/site/veriwstool/.
