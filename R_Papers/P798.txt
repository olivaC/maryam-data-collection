Condition checking for page integration of third party services
A widget generator may be configured to provide, to a browser application, a widget that is executable to be rendered in conjunction with a page rendered by the browser application. A protection manager may be configured to provide, to the browser application and in conjunction with the widget, a protection script that is executable within a page context of the page and separate from a widget context of the widget. The protection script, during execution, validates a condition associated with a frame of the page that is used to render the widget, and enables functionality of the widget within the page, based on validation of the condition.
