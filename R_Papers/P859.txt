Security challenges of a changing energy landscape
The German electric energy industry is under change. The Smart Grid, Smart Metering and electric mobility are being researched and implemented. It will have implications for the security and privacy of our everyday-lives if security and privacy are not taken into account during this change. Therefore the identification and mitigation of security and privacy issues of prospective technologies is essential before respective systems are built. In this paper we identify the current legislative measures to induce change, derive the necessary technical changes and analyze them with respect to security and privacy challenges. We identify several security and privacy challenges: New paradigms like mobile energy consumers or bidirectional communication with electrical meters, isolated systems like Industrial Control Systems or Home Automation Networks that will eventually be connected to public networks and huge amounts of privacy-related data that will be created by respective systems. We conclude that the energy sector is an interesting field for security and privacy research and that now is the time to ensure a secure and private future of energy supply.
