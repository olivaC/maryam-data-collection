Concolic testing on embedded software-case studies on mobile platform programs
Current industrial testing practices often build test cases in a manual manner, which degrades both the effectiveness and efficiency of testing. To alleviate this problem, concolic testing generates test cases that can achieve high coverage in an automated fashion. This paper describes case studies of applying concolic testing to mobile platform C programs that have been developed by Samsung Electronics. Through this work, we have detected new faults in the Samsung Linux Platform (SLP) file manager and security library.
