Predicting software build errors
Systems and methods for predicting a software build error are described herein. In one example, a method includes detecting a plurality of changes in software. The method also includes identifying a plurality of change lists, wherein a change list is identified for each of the plurality of changes in the software. Additionally, the method includes identifying a characteristic for each change list in the plurality of change lists. Furthermore, the method includes calculating a plurality of probabilities based at least in part on the characteristic of each of the plurality of change lists, wherein each of the probabilities indicates the likelihood of one of the plurality of change lists creating the software build error. The method also includes reporting the plurality of probabilities of the software build error.
