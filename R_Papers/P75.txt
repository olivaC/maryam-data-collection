Reducing human factors in software security architectures
In the recent past it has become clear that there are inherent problems with the security models of popular programming platforms such as Java, Android, and so forth. In this work we pinpoint sources of those problems, and explain the relative strengths and weaknesses of the security models for C/C++, Java, .NET, Android and JavaScript. As it turns out, many problems are caused by the fact that the models are so complex that they overstrain not only end-users but even expert developers. Out of this experience we argue that a new line of security models, based on object-capabilities, can help reduce the inherent complexity, preparing the ground for software that is secure by design.
