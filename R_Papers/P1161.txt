Aspect model unweaving
Since software systems need to be continuously available, their ability to evolve at runtime is a key issue. The emergence of models@runtime, combined with Aspect-Oriented Modeling techniques, is a promising approach to tame the complexity of adaptive systems. However, with no support for aspect unweaving, these approaches are not agile enough in an adaptive system context. In case of small modifications, the adapted model has to be generated by again weaving all the aspects, even those unchanged. This paper shows how aspects can be unwoven, based on a precise traceability metamodel dedicated to aspect model weaving. We analyze traceability models, which describe how aspects were woven into a base, to determine the extent to which an aspect has affected the woven model in order to determine how it can be unwoven. Aspect unweaving is finally performed by applying inverse operations of a sub-sequence of the weaving operations in opposite order.
