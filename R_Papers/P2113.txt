Determining the vulnerability of computer software applications to attacks
Determining the vulnerability of computer software applications to attacks by identifying a defense-related variable within a computer software application that is assigned results of a defense operation defending against a predefined type of attack, identifying a control-flow predicate dominating a security-sensitive operation within the application, identifying a data-flow dependent variable in the application that is data-flow dependent on the defense-related variable, determining whether the control-flow predicate uses the data-flow dependent variable to make a branching decision and whether a control-flow path leading to the security-sensitive operation is taken only if the data-flow dependent variable is compared against a value of a predefined type, determining that the security-sensitive operation is safe from the attack if both control-flow conditions are true, and determining that the application is safe from the attack if all security-sensitive operations in the application are determined to be safe from the attack.
