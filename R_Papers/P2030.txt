Self-repair and distributed-repair of applications
A method is provided to instrument applications with an instrumentation policy that is visually configurable and allows for run-time modifications of the policy. Instrumentation is achieved without modifying the source code of the applications. Modification of the instrumentation policy of an application is applied without re-compiling, re-deploying, and re-provisioning the application. The instrumentation tracks the flow of values at run time throughout the execution of an application and fixes any security violation automatically by dynamically modifying any value that violates integrity or confidentiality.
