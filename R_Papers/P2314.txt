Termination of Periodically Monotonic Affine Loops
—We present a technique for locating infinite paths within a program’s loop blocks, in particular examining loops whose defining variables are updated by transformations of an affine nature. Along with a few auxiliary results, we show that this technique will always locate such paths, if they exist, for update transformations which periodically shift the values of the loop’s variables no nearer to their relevant bounds, which are defined in the loop’s guard condition. All single-variable and cyclic affine loops possess this property. Finally we describe this technique’s implementation, which has been performed with the aid of Java Pathfinder, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) open-source software verifier, and also note how our technique can be adapted to prove that termination holds for affine loops which exhibit periodically decreasing behaviour
