Generation of library models for verification of android applications
Android applications are difficult to verify and test since they have many external dependencies. To overcome this problem, environment generation can be used to create a model of the environment to simulate the behavior of these external dependencies. Creating this environment model manually is a tedious process and although there are many techniques available to generate models, the key lies in identifying how these techniques can be applied to a specific domain. In this paper we discuss two static analysis tools OCSEGen [3] and Modgen [1] and how they can be applied to the Android domain to generate models for specific parts of the environment.
