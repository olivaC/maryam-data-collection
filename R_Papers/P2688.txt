A power system redution method for the torsional torque analysis of turbine-generator shafts
This paper proposes a method to reduce a large power system to a simple system in order to analyze the torsional torque of a turbine-generator shaft. First, a large power system is divided into 2 areas such as the area of concern and the external area. Secondly, the external area is simplified to the equivalent Thevenin's voltage sources. The reduced simple power system is modeled with EMTP-RV software to simulate the power system disturbances in accordance with the predetermined sequence of events. To verify the proposed reduction method, the outputs of EMTP-RV such as voltage profile, active power and reactive power at the generator output terminal in the reduced power system are compared with the results of PSS/E simulation in the original large power system.
