Attacks on the Client Device
By directly attacking the client device, the attacker can gain control over the device, allowing him/her to manipulate the userâ€™s actions, steal sensitive information or abuse the device for other activities, such as denial of service attacks. In this chapter, we discuss two important attack vectors. The first attack vector uses drive-by download techniques to exploit a memory corruption vulnerability in the client software, for example, a buffer overflow vulnerability in the browser. The second attack vector attacks the client device through a malicious browser extension, which is characterized by a high degree of control over the browser.
