Remediation of security vulnerabilities in computer software
Processing a downgrader specification by constructing a set of candidate downgrader placement locations found within a computer software application, where each of the candidate downgrader placement locations corresponds to a transition between a different pair of instructions within the computer software application, and where each of the transitions participates in any of a plurality of data flows in a set of security-sensitive data flows within the computer software application, applying a downgrader specification to the set of candidate downgrader placement locations, and determining that the downgrader specification provides full coverage of the set of security-sensitive data flows within the computer software application if at least one candidate downgrader placement location within each of the security-sensitive data flows is a member of the set of candidate downgrader placement locations.
