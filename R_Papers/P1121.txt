Modeling, composing, and testing of security concerns in a Model-Driven Security approach
Model-Driven Security (MDS) has emerged as a promising sound methodology for supporting the development of secure systems nowadays. Following the advances in MDS, this research work aims at 1) developing new modeling techniques to represent multiple security concerns, 2) (automatically) composing security models with the business logic model (called target model), and 3) testing the security model composition and the resulting secure system against security requirements. These three objectives converge to an integrated MDS framework (and tool chain) which 1) allows a target system model to embed various security concerns, 2) enables the generation of implementation code including configured security infrastructures, and 3) makes these security properties testable by construction. This paper presents the main research modules, the results we have achieved so far, and the main points for future work.
