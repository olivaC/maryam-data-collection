Évaluation de la fiabilité d'une table de hachage distribuée construite dans un plan hyperbolique.
A distributed hash table needs to route requests in a scalable way. Although several solutions do exist, they often require nodes to connect to each others by following a specific topology and to maintain routing tables. We propose a greedy routing algorithm based on virtual coordinates taken from the hyperbolic plane for building a distributed hash table while letting nodes connect to any others as they wish and without maintaining any routing table. In this paper, we use this algorithm to define a new scalable and reliable distributed hash table system. We provide a scalability analysis and we evaluate its performance and efficiency by carrying out simulations including other existing solutions. Results show that our system brings more flexibility to the nodes while still being scalable and reliable in presence of churn.
