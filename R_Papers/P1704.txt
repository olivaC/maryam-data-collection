Testing Inter-Layer and Inter-Task Interactions in Real-Time Embedded Systems
Real-time embedded systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, controlling a wide variety of popular and safety-critical devices. Testing is the most commonly used method for validating software systems, and effective testing methodologies could be helpful for improving the dependability of these systems. In this paper we present a methodology for testing real-time embedded systems, directed specifically at exercising the interactions between system layers, and between the multiple user tasks that enact application behaviors, from the application layer. We augment this with a dynamic analysis on testing data that can detect failures related to incorrect usage of resources within critical sections. We show that our methodology can effectively detect faults in these systems.
