ACS: An Addressless Configuration Support for efficient partial reconfigurations
This paper presents a complete design of a reconfigurable architecture support system, called ACS (an Addressless Configuration Support), which provides efficient access to non-contiguous reconfigurable locations in reconfigurable systems. ACS reduces the amount of partial reconfiguration information required by removing a large amount of addressing information and padding as found in Virtex-4 bitstreams. ACS improves significantly on the distTree architecture previously proposed by us. ACS introduces the selector block which connects the leaf nodes to a consecutive block of reconfiguration locations called a frame set. The system allows any number of leaf nodes customised to the size of the device, thereby providing much more flexibility. The hardware costs have also been reduced significantly over the distTree design. Together with the new marker loading mechanism, ACS is readily applicable to SRAM-based FPGAs. This new ACS system is benchmarked using eight real-world applications against a Virtex-4 device and the results show 6.83%â€“15.07% speedups when the reconfiguration granularity is set to a Virtex-4 frame.
