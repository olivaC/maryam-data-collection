A Petri net-based distributed control of automated manufacturing systems with assembly operations
Because they bewilder some processes to wait for some resources held by others but will never be released, deadlock issues pose adverse effect on the design and operation of automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). A variety of important Petri net-based methods have been developed to cope with deadlock problems in AMSs. For them, a big challenge is that either they demand structurally-defined and globally-restrained specifications or they cannot perform on-line diagnosis owing to their static and rigid supervisor topologies. Compared to these existing methods, this paper focuses on the development of an innovative distributed supervisor which can avoid deadlocks for AMSs with assembly operations without checking global information and designing topological supervisors. On the contrary, our supervisor is achieved in an online and dynamic way, being adaptive to many contingencies like resource failures and recoveries.
