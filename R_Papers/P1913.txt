Future internet testing with fittest
The complexity of the technologies involved in the Future Internet makes testing extremely challenging and demands for novel approaches and major advancement in the field. The overall aim of the FITTEST project is to address these testing challenges, by developing an integrated environment for automated testing, which can monitor the Future Internet application under test and adapt to the dynamic changes observed. Future Internet applications do not remain fixed after their release, services and components can be dynamically added by customers. Consequently, FITTEST testing will be continuous and post-release such that maintenance and quality assurance can cope with the changes in the intended use of an application after release. The testing environment will integrate, adapt and automate various techniques for continuous Future Internet testing (dynamic model inference, model-based testing, log-based diagnosis, oracle learning, combinatorial testing, concurrent testing, regression testing).
