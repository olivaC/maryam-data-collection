Energy efficiency.
This project is implemented because of the recommendation from our supervisor Dr Deepak to seize this chance upon this project when speaking to Joseph Loh, the director of G-energy Pte Ltd which is Singapore's accredited ESCO (Energy Services Company) Company. The aims of the project were to perform comparative study of energy efficiency, energy audit and a case study of SIA training center. Although we are pursuing Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, we seldom come across to energy efficiency and have a really deep understanding of what it is and not to mention that we know nothing about energy auditing. Hence, the first thing we did was to search on the internet to get some idea of what energy efficiency is all about. In the end, we are able to perform energy auditing and able to simplify an over-designed plant rooms.
