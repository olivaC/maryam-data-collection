Distributed static analysis of computer software applications
A method for distributed static analysis of computer software applications, includes: statically analyzing instructions of a computer software application; identifying at least one entry point in the computer software application; assigning a primary agent to statically analyze the computer software application from the entry point; assigning a secondary agent to statically analyze a call site encountered by the primary agent and produce a static analysis summary of the call site; and presenting results of any of the static analyses via a computer-controlled output device.
