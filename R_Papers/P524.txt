Software Verificationâ€”A Scalable, Model-Driven, Empirically Grounded Approach
Software is present in most systems across all industries, including energy, automotive, health care, maritime, aerospace, and banking, to name just a few. Software systems are increasingly taking on safety- and business-critical roles and growing in complexity. One crucial aspect of software development is therefore to ensure the dependability of such systems, that is, their reliability, safety, and robustness. This is achieved by several complementary means of verification, ranging from early analysis of system specifications and designs to systematic testing of the executable software. Such verification activities are, however, difficult and time-consuming. This stems in part from the sheer complexity of most software systems and because they must accommodate changing requirements from many stakeholders.
