Bottom-up technologies for reuse: automated extractive adoption of software product lines
Adopting Software Product Line (SPL) engineering principles demands a high up-front investment. Bottom-Up Technologies for Reuse (BUT4Reuse) is a generic and extensible tool aimed to leverage existing similar software products in order to help in extractive SPL adoption. The envisioned users are 1) SPL adopters and 2) Integrators of techniques and algorithms to provide automation in SPL adoption activities. We present the methodology it implies for both types of users and we present the validation studies that were already conducted. BUT4Reuse tool and source code are publicly available under the EPL license.
