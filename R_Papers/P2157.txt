Sound and effective data-flow analysis in the presence of aliasing
A method, an apparatus, and a computer program product are disclosed that include tracking, using a data flow model of a program suitable for taint analysis of the program, information from sources of taint to entities in a heap using a model of the heap based on the program. The tracking is performed so that the information is relevant for taint propagation and is performed in a manner that is field-sensitive for the entities in the heap. The method, apparatus, and computer program product also include, based on output of the tracking, the operation of performing data-flow analysis to determine taint flow from the sources of the taint through data flow paths to sinks using the taint.
