End-to-End Taint Tracking for Detection and Mitigation of Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Applications
The embodiments described in this disclosure may be adapted to detect and mitigate tainted content in network communications across client-server boundaries using a pair of complementary taint engines at both ends of the network. Methods, systems and computer readable storage media are adapted to receive request from a web application of a client system and generate standard responses. The header of the request can include a request taint value that can be evaluated to determine whether the request is a standard network transfer protocol request (e.g., HTTP request) or a multipart network transfer protocol request (e.g., a CTTP request). If the request is a multipart network transfer protocol request, a multipart network transfer protocol response can be constructing based on the generated standard network transfer protocol response, and client systems can be configured to detect tainted content based on the multipart network transfer protocol response.
