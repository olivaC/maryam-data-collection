Analysis and Synthesis of Floating-point Programs (Dagstuhl Seminar 17352)
This report summarises the presentations, discussion sessions and panel that took place during the Dagstuhl seminar on "Analysis and Synthesis of Floating-point Programs" that took place during August 27 - 30, 2017. We hope that the report will provide a useful resource for researchers today who are interested in understanding the state-of-the-art and open problems related to analysing and synthesising floating-point programs, and as a historical resource helping to clarify the status of this field in 2017.
