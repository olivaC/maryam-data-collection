Crosscutting concern documentation by visual query of business processes
Business processes can be very large and may contain several different concerns, scattered across the process and tangled with other concerns. Crosscutting concerns are difficult to find and locate, thus making process design and evolution hard. In this work, we propose a method to support business designers in documenting structural as well as business domain crosscutting concerns, thus facilitating concern understanding and evolution. We introduce a visual query language, which allows business designers to mine, explore, document and evolve crosscutting concerns, by means of visual queries performed on the business process. Such queries can be stored as additional design artefacts which document the existence and location of crosscutting design concerns.
