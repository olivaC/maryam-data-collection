Web page integrity validation
An aspect identifier of an integrity validation script may be provided to a browser application, that, during execution thereof by the browser application when rendering a page, identifies a document object model (DOM) aspect of a DOM of the page. A copy generator of the integrity validation script may be provided to the browser application that, during execution thereof by the browser application when rendering the page, generates a copy of the identified DOM aspect. The integrity validation script is configured to test an integrity of the DOM based on attempted deletion of the identified DOM aspect, while maintaining the identified DOM aspect through the copy thereof.
