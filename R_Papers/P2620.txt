Characterizing Software Engineering Work with Personas Based on Knowledge Worker Actions
Mistaking versatility for universal skills, some companies tend to categorize all software engineers the same not knowing a difference exists. For example, a company may select one of many software engineers to complete a task, later finding that the engineerâ€™s skills and style do not match those needed to successfully complete that task. This can result in delayed task completion and demonstrates that a one-size fits all concept should not apply to how software engineers work. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of different software engineers and their working styles we interviewed 21 participants and surveyed 868 software engineers at a large software company and asked them about their work in terms of knowledge worker actions. We identify how tasks, collaboration styles, and perspectives of autonomy can significantly effect different approaches to software engineering work. To characterize differences, we describe empirically informed personas on how they work. Our defined software engineering personas include those with focused debugging abilities, engineers with an active interest in learning, experienced advisors who serve as experts in their role, and more. Our study and results serve as a resource for building products, services, and tools around these software engineering personas.
