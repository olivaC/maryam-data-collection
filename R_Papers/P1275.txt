Towards robust and effective trust management for security: A survey
There is a need for robust and effective trust management. Different security problems result in different requirements to the design of trust management, and the existing attacks in trust management for security are yet to be solved. In this paper, we first propose a framework to classify desired properties of trust management for each type of security problems. We then investigate typical representative attacks and existing solutions in trust management for security. By considering both these security properties and attacks on trust management systems, our work serves to propel the design of more effective and robust trust management systems for security.
