Anomaly detection at the level of run time data structures
A useful embodiment of the invention is directed to a method associated with a computer program comprising one or more basic blocks, wherein the program defines and uses multiple data structures, such as the list of all customers of a bank along with their account information. The method includes identifying one or more invariants, wherein each invariant is associated with one of the data structures. The method further includes determining at specified times whether an invariant has been violated. Responsive to detecting a violation of one of the invariants, the detected violation is flagged as an anomaly.
