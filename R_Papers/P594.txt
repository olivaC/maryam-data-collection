Unbounded data model verification using SMT solvers
The growing influence of web applications in every aspect of society makes their dependability an immense concern. A fundamental building block of web applications that use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is the data model, which specifies the object classes and the relations among them. We present an approach for unbounded, automated verification of data models that 1) extracts a formal data model from an Object Relational Mapping, 2) converts verification queries about the data model to queries about the satisfiability of formulas in the theory of uninterpreted functions, and 3) uses a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to check the satisfiability of the resulting formulas. We implemented this approach and applied it to five open-source Rails applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is feasible, and is more efficient than SAT-based bounded verification.
