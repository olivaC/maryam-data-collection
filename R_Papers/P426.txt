A model-driven approach to offline trace checking of temporal properties with ocl
Offline trace checking is a procedure for evaluating requirements over a log of events produced by a system. The goal of this paper is to present a practical and scalable solution for the offline checking of the temporal requirements of a system, which can be used in contexts where model-driven engineering is already a practice, where temporal specifications should be written in a domain-specific language not requiring a strong mathematical background, and where relying on standards and industry-strength tools for property checking is a fundamental prerequisite. The main contributions are: the TemPsy language, a domainspecific specification language based on common property specification patterns, and extended with new constructs; a model-driven offline trace checking procedure based on the mapping of requirements written in TemPsy into OCL (Object Constraint Language) constraints on a conceptual model on execution traces, which can be evaluated using an OCL checker; the implementation of this trace checking procedure in the TemPsy-Check tool; the evaluation of the scalability of TemPsy-Check and its comparison to a state-of-the-art alternative technology. The proposed approach has been applied to a case study developed in collaboration with a public service organization, active in the domain of business process modeling for eGovernment.
