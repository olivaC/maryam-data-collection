Detecting vulnerable applications
A method and system of determining a vulnerability of software. Libraries are downloaded and stored in a database. For each library, a set of features are extracted and stored in a library index table of the database. For each library, it is determined whether it poses a security concern and flagged accordingly in the library index table. Applications are downloaded and stored in the database. For each application a set of features are extracted and stored in an application index table of the database. For each application, the set of features of the application of the application are compared to the set of features of each of the libraries in the library index table to identify which libraries in the library index table are associated with the application. For each application, a name of the application and names of the associated libraries are stored in a vulnerability reference table in the database.
