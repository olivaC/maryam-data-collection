Visual vs. DOM-based web locators: An empirical study
Automation in Web testing has been successfully supported by DOM-based tools that allow testers to program the interactions of their test cases with the Web application under test. More recently a new generation of visual tools has been proposed where a test case interacts with the Web application by recognising the images of the widgets that can be actioned upon and by asserting the expected visual appearance of the result. In this paper, we first discuss the inherent robustness of the locators created by following the visual and DOM-based approaches and we then compare empirically a visual and a DOM-based tool, taking into account both the cost for initial test suite development from scratch and the cost for test suite maintenance during code evolution. Since visual tools are known to be computationally demanding, we also measure the test suite execution time. Results indicate that DOM-based locators are generally more robust than visual ones and that DOM-based test cases can be developed from scratch and evolved at lower cost. Moreover, DOM-based test cases require a lower execution time. However, depending on the specific features of the Web application under test and its expected evolution, in some cases visual locators might be the best choice (e.g., when the visual appearance is more stable than the structure).
