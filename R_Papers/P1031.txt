Automated analysis of industrial embedded software
For the last few decades, automated software analysis techniques such as software model checking and concolic testing have advanced in a large degree. However, such techniques are not frequently applied to industrial software due to steep learning curve and hidden costs to apply these techniques to industrial software in practice. Therefore, to enable technology transfer to industry, it is essential to conduct concrete case studies applying automated techniques to real-world industrial software. These studies can serve as references for field engineers who want to improve quality of software by adopting automated analysis techniques. Furthermore, concrete applications of such techniques can guide new research goals and directions to solve practical limitations observed in the studies. In this paper, we describe our experience of applying various automated software analysis techniques to industrial embedded software such as flash memory storage platform and smartphone platform.
