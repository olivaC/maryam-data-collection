Synthesizing inputs to preserve functionality
A computer implemented method of preserving functionality in a computer program by generating customized mock inputs may include identifying a set of functionalities of the computer program, where a first functionality has a first input, and a second functionality has a second input. The method may also include determining a first and a second constraint respectively on the first and second inputs, where the first constraint defines a set of values of the first input which enables the first functionality, and the second constraint defines a set of values of the second input which enables the second functionality. The method may then include generating a constraint satisfaction problem including the first and second constraints, and determining whether a tuple of mock input values exists that satisfy the constraint satisfaction problem. The method may additionally include providing the tuple to the computer program as the customized mock inputs.
