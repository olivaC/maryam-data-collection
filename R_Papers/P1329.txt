Symmetry Detection for Model Checking
We present an automatic approach to detecting symmetry relations for general concurrent models. Despite the success of symmetry reduction in mitigating state explosion problem, one essential step towards its soundness and effectiveness, i.e., how to discover sufficient symmetries with least human effort, is often either overlooked or oversimplified. In this work, we show how a concurrent model can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and present an algorithm capable of detecting arbitrary symmetries arising from the CSP which induce automorphisms of the model. Unlike previous approaches, our method can automatically detect both various process and data symmetries as demonstrated via a number of systems. Further, we propose an inductive approach to inferring symmetries in a parameterized system from the symmetries detected over a small set of its instances.
