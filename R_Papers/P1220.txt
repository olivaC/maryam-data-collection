Critical stages and their application in large scale automated manufacturing systems via Petri nets
It often takes much time and effort to synthesize the supervisory controller given an automated manufacturing system (AMS). Any modification may lead to another synthesis procedure from the scratch. This work is motivated by the problem of distributed supervisor synthesis for complex large scale models of real systems. Existing approaches generally require the enumeration of all the states or siphons. Based on them, a centralized supervisor can be synthesized to perform on-line control. In this paper, we provide an on-line and realtime predictive control solution in order to significantly mitigate the computational burden and reduce the supervisor size. Our approach can minimize the communication amount among different processes, tolerate many contingencies like resource failure and improve system performance like throughput. These promote its applicability to many practical large scale systems. The supervisor synthesis procedure can also be adapted to other event-driven systems like warehouse, transportation, and logistics systems, which require a distributed and networked supervisor.
