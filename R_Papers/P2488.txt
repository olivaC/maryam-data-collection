Droidmate: A robust and extensible test generator for android
Abstract:
DroidMate is a fully automated GUI execution generator for Android apps. DroidMate explores an app, i.e. (a) repeatedly reads at runtime the device GUI and monitored calls to Android APIs methods and (b) makes a decision what next GUI action (click, long-click, text entry, etc.) to execute, based on that data and provided exploration strategy. The process continues until some termination criterion is met.DroidMate is:- fully automatic: after it has been set up, the exploration itself does not require human presence. - extensible: without recompiling DroidMate, anybody can run it with their own exploration strategy, termination criterion or set of monitored methods.- robust: tested on 126 apps being in top 5 in all Google Play categories except Games, it ran successfully on 123 of them. - easy to setup: it works on Android devices and emulators out-of-the-box, without root or OS modifications. - easy to modify: documented sources, built and tested with continuous integration server, are publicly available.
