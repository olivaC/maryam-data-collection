Optimizing test data payload selection for testing computer software applications that employ data sanitizers and data validators
Testing computer software applications is implemented by probing a computer software application to determine the presence in the computer software application of any data-checking features, and applying a rule to the data-checking features that are determined to be present in the computer software application, thereby producing a testing set of inputs. The testing set includes any sets of inputs that were used to test sets of data-checking software, where each of the sets of data-checking software includes one or more data sanitizers and/or data validators, and where the rule is configured to produce the testing set to include one or more of the sets of inputs when the rule is applied to any of the data-checking features. The computer software application is tested using the testing set.
