Websand: Server-driven outbound web-application sandboxing
WebSand tackles security beyond dealing with low-level vulnerabilities at a higher level of abstraction: The technical strategy is to deal with security in a server-driven fashion. Clearly, security preferences and requirements from endusers at the client-side need to be taken into account, but primarily service developers at the server-side have the required expertise and context information to define adequate policies to be enforced. Moreover, server-driven security can be deployed relatively easily, since the need for updating the client-side platform is minimized. Since WebSand strands for “Server-driven Outbound Web-application Sandboxing”, the project’s overall goal is –along with this strategy– to empower web application developers, service providers, and users in designing, implementing, and running secure applications: Developers and service providers can develop and deploy secure web applications on their application servers; users will benefit from the project’s results by transparently receiving a suitable security platform for their applications. WebSand aims to deliver this non-disruptively, i.e. by building upon existing web application technologies wherever possible to allow a seamless, immediate adoption of results in existing and future web applications.
