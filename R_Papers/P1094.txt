Potential component leaks in Android apps: An investigation into a new feature set for malware detection
We discuss the capability of a new feature set for malware detection based on potential component leaks (PCLs). PCLs are defined as sensitive data-flows that involve Android inter-component communications. We show that PCLs are common in Android apps and that malicious applications indeed manipulate significantly more PCLs than benign apps. Then, we evaluate a machine learning-based approach relying on PCLs. Experimental validations show high performance for identifying malware, demonstrating that PCLs can be used for discriminating malicious apps from benign apps.
