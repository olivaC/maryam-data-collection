Why testing autonomous agents is hard and what can be done about it
Intuitively, autonomous agents are hard to test. Their autonomy and their flexible, context-aware behaviour implies unpredictability, and their social ability intuitively leads to unpredictable emergent behaviour. On the other hand, software agents are programs just like those designed and developed in an object-oriented, procedural fashion, or under any other approach, and just because something is intuitive does not mean it is necessarily correct. In their separate respective groups, the authors of this position paper have been examining exactly why agents may be harder to test than the kinds of software we would expect to be developed without an agentoriented approach, quantifying this difficulty, and/or proposing means to address it. This position paper summarises and expands on our groupsâ€™ work for the purposes of discussion. While we are aware that there are other relevant approaches to tackling agent testing by other groups (including some presented at the Agent-Oriented Software Engineering workshop series), we do not attempt to give a state of the art survey here, but instead refer to a forthcoming survey of this area by Nguyen et al. [12].
