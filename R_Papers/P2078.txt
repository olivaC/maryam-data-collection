Rule matching in the presence of languages with no types or as an adjunct to current analyses for security vulnerability analysis
A method includes a computing system reading a rule file that includes one or more rules having specified paths to methods, such that each method corresponds to one of a sink, source, or sanitizer. The method includes the computing system matching the methods to corresponding ones of sinks, sources, or sanitizers determined through a static analysis of an application. The static analysis determines at least flows from sources of information to sinks that use the information. The method includes the computing system, using the sinks, sources, and sanitizers found by the matching, performing a taint analysis to determine at least tainted flows from sources to sinks, the tainted flows being flows that pass information to sinks without the information being endorsed by a sanitizer. Apparatus and program products are also shown.
