Optimizing sparse schema-less data in data stores
Various embodiments of the invention relate to optimizing storage of schema-less data. At least one of a schema-less dataset including a plurality of resources one or more query workloads associated with the plurality of resources is received. Each resource is associated with at least a plurality of properties. At least one set of co-occurring properties from the plurality of properties is identified. A graph including a plurality of nodes is generated. Each of the nodes represents a unique property in the set of co-occurring properties. The graph further includes an edge connecting each node representing a pair of co-occurring properties. A schema is generated based on the graph that assigns a column identifier from a table to each unique property represented by one of the nodes in the graph.
