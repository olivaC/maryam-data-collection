Detecting error states when interacting with web applications
Detecting error states when interacting with web applications is performed by accessing a first web page of a web application, determining that the first web page includes an input validation operation, configuring an input to cause the input validation operation to effect an error state, providing the input to the first web page, thereby effecting the error state, identifying a feature that is absent from the first web page before the input is provided to the first web page and present in the first web page after the input is provided to the first web page, and detecting that a second web page of the web application is in an error state if the feature is present in the second web page.
