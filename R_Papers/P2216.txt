Hybrid Program Analysis
A hybrid program analysis method includes initiating a static program analysis of an application, generating, by a static program analyzer, a query to a dynamic program analyzer upon determining a code construct of the application requiring dynamic analysis, resolving, by the dynamic program analyzer, the query into a set of arguments with which to invoke the code construct of the application, generating, by the dynamic program analyzer, the set of arguments, invoking, by the dynamic program analyzer, the code construct of the application using set of arguments, answering, by the dynamic program analyzer, the query, and continuing the static program analysis of the application.
