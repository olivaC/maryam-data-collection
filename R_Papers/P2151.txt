Enhanced string analysis that improves accuracy of static analysis
A method includes determining, as part of a static analysis of a program, links between functions in the program and performing, as part of the static analysis, string analysis on strings used in the program to determine additional links between the functions in the program. The method further includes outputting, as part of the static analysis, indications of at least the links between the functions and the additional links between the functions. Apparatus, computer programs, and program products are also disclosed.
