SQL Injection Attacks
Structured Query Language injection attacks (SQLIAs) are one of the major security threats for Web applications [1]. SQLIAs are a class of code injection attacks that take advantage of a lack of validation of user input. These attacks occur when developers combine hard-coded strings with user-provided input to create dynamic queries to an underlying database. Intuitively, if user input is not properly validated, attackers may be able to change the developerâ€™s intended Structured Query Language (SQL) command by inserting new SQL keywords or operators through specially crafted input strings. As a result, attackers can get access to (and even control) the underlying database, which may contain sensitive or confidential information. Despite the potential severity of SQLIAs, many Web applications remain vulnerable to such attacks.
