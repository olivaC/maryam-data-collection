Method and apparatus for storing sparse graph data as multi-dimensional cluster
A system for storing graph data as a multi-dimensional cluster having a database with a graph dataset containing data and relationships between data pairs and a schema list of storage methods that use a table with columns and rows associated with data or relationships. An analyzer module to collect statistics of a graph dataset and a dimension identification module to identify a plurality of dimensions that each represent a column in the table. A schema creation and loading module creates a modified storage method and having a plurality of distinct table blocks and a plurality of table block indexes, one index for each table block and arranges the data and relationships in the given graph dataset in accordance with the modified storage method to create the multi-dimensional cluster.
