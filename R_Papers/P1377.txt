Model checking CSP revisited: Introducing a process analysis toolkit
FDR, initially introduced decades ago, is the de facto analyzer for Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). Model checking techniques have been evolved rapidly since then. This paper describes Pat, i.e., a process analysis toolkit which complements FDR in several aspects. Pat is designed to analyze event-based compositional system models specified using CSP as well as shared variables and asynchronous message passing. It supports automated refinement checking, model checking of LTL extended with events, etc. In this paper, we highlight how partial order reduction is applied to improve refinement checking in Pat. Experiment results show that Pat outperforms FDR in some cases.
