Event-based formalization of safety-critical operating system standards: An experience report on ARINC 653 using Event-B
Standards play the key role in safety-critical systems. Errors in standards could mislead system developer's understanding and introduce bugs into system implementations. In this paper, we present an Event-B formalization and verification for the ARINC 653 standard, which provides a standardized interface between safety-critical real-time operating systems and application software, as well as a set of functionalities aimed to improve the safety and certification process of such safety-critical systems. The formalization is a complete model of ARINC 653, and provides a necessary foundation for the formal development and verification of ARINC 653 compliant operating systems and applications. Three hidden errors and three cases of incomplete specification were discovered from the verification using the Event-B formal reasoning approach.
