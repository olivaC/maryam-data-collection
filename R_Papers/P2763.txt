Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on FAMIX and MOOSE in Software Reengineering (FAMOOSr'09)
The goal of the FAMOOSr workshop is to strengthen the community of researchers and practitioners who are working in re- and reverse engineering, by providing a forum for building future research using Moose and FAMIX as shared infrastructure. Research should be collaborative and supported by tools. The increasing amount of data available about software systems poses new challenges for reengineering research, as the proposed approaches need to scale. In this context, concerns about meta-modeling and analysis techniques need to be augmented by technical concerns about how to reuse and how to build upon the efforts of previous research. That is why Moose is an open-source software for researchers to build and share their analysis, meta-models, and data. Both FAMIX and Moose started in the context of FAMOOS, a European research project on object-oriented frameworks. Back in 1997 Moose was as a simple implementation of the FAMIX meta-model, which was a language independent meta-model for object-oriented systems. However over the past decade, Moose has been used in a growing number of research projects and has evolved to be a generic environment for various reverse and reengineering activities. In the same time, FAMIX was extended to support emerging research interest such as dynamic analysis, evolution analysis, identifier analysis, bug tracking analysis, or visualization. Recent work includes analysis of software architecture and semantic annotations. Currently, several research groups are using Moose as a platform, or FAMIX as a meta-model, and other groups announced interest in using them in the future.
