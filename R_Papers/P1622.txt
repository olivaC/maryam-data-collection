Model based analysis and test generation for flight software
We describe a framework for model-based analysis and test case generation in the context of a heterogeneous model-based development paradigm that uses and combines MathWorks and UML 2.0 models and the associated code generation tools. This paradigm poses novel challenges to analysis and test case generation that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been addressed before. The framework is based on a common intermediate representation for different modeling formalisms and leverages and extends model checking and symbolic execution tools for model analysis and test case generation, respectively. We discuss the application of our framework to software models for a NASA flight mission.
