Mining android apps for anomalies
How do we know a program does what it claims to do? Our CHABADA prototype can cluster Android™ apps by their description topics and identify outliers in each cluster with respect to their API usage. A “weather” app that sends messages thus becomes an anomaly; likewise, a “messaging” app would typically not be expected to access the current location and would also be identified. In this paper we present a new approach for anomaly detection that improves the classification results of our original CHABADA paper [1]. Applied on a set of 22,500+ Android applications, our CHABADA prototype can now predict 74% of novel malware and as such, without requiring any known malware patterns, maintains a false positive rate close to 10%.
