Mining families of android applications for extractive SPL adoption
The myriads of smart phones around the globe gave rise to a vast proliferation of mobile applications. These applications target an increasing number of user profiles and tasks. In this context, Android is a leading technology for their development and on-line markets are the main means for their distribution. In this paper we motivate, from two perspectives, the mining of these markets with the objective to identify families of apps variants in the wild. The first perspective is related to research activities where building realistic case studies for evaluating extractive SPL adoption techniques are needed. The second is related to a large-scale, world-wide and time-aware study of reuse practice in an industry which is now flourishing among all others within the software engineering community. This study is relevant to assess potential for SPLE practices adoption. We present initial implementations of the mining process and we discuss analyses of variant families.
