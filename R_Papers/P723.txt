Scalable property-sensitive points-to analysis for program code
A novel system, computer program product, and method are disclosed for transforming a program to facilitate points-to analysis. The method begins with accessing at least a portion of program code, such as JavaScript. In one example, a method with at least one dynamic property correlation is identified for extraction. When a method m is identified for extraction with the dynamic property correlation, a body of the loop l in the method m is extracted. A new method mp is created to include the body of the loop l with the variable i as a parameter. The loop l is substituted in the program code of the method m with the new method mp to create a transformed program code.
