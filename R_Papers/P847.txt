Towards stateless, client-side driven Cross-Site Request Forgery protection for Web applications.
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is one of the dominant threats in the Web application landscape. In this paper, we present a lightweight and stateless protection mechanism that can be added to an existing application without requiring changes to the applicationâ€™s code. The key functionality of the approach, which is based on the double-submit technique, is purely implemented on the client-side. This way full coverage of client-side generation of HTTP requests is provided.
