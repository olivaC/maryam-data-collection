Evaluating Search-Based Techniques With Statistical Tests
This tutorial covers the basics of how to use statistical tests to  evaluate and compare search-algorithms, in particular when applied  on software engineering problems. Search-algorithms like  Hill Climbing and Genetic Algorithms are randomised. Running  such randomised algorithms twice on the same problem can give  different results. It is hence important to run such algorithms multiple  times to collect average results, and avoid so publishing wrong  conclusions that were based on just luck. However, there is the  question of how often such runs should be repeated. Given a set  of n repeated experiments, is such n large enough to draw sound  conclusions? Or should had more experiments been run? Statistical  tests like the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-test can be used to  answer these important questions.
