A synergistic approach for distributed symbolic execution using test ranges
Symbolic execution is a systematic program analysis technique that has received a lot of attention in the research community. However, scaling symbolic execution continues to pose a major challenge. This paper introduces Synergise, a novel two-fold integration approach. One, it integrates distributed analysis and constraint re-use to enhance symbolic execution using feasible ranges, which allow sharing of constraint solving results among different workers without communicating or sharing potentially large constraint databases (as required traditionally). Two, it integrates complementary techniques for test input generation, e.g., search-based generation and symbolic execution, for creating higher quality tests using unexplored ranges, which allows symbolic execution to re-use tests created by another technique for effective distribution of exploration of previously unexplored paths.
