Black-box testing of web applications with client-side code evaluation
Detecting security vulnerabilities in web applications by interacting with a web application at a computer server during its execution at the computer server, identifying client-side instructions provided by the web application responsive to an interaction with the web application, where the client-side instructions are configured to be implemented by a client computer that receives the client-side instructions from the computer server, evaluating the identified client-side instructions, and identifying a security vulnerability associated with the client-side instructions.
