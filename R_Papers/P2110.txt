Runtime protection of web services
Protecting a runtime Web service application. A web service application is instrumented to log its operation and allow recreation of its execution trace. Trace point vulnerabilities are identified using one or more data payloads. Candidate trace point operations associated with the trace point vulnerabilities are identified. Supplementary candidate operations are computed based on the existing trace point operations and the one or more data payloads. The Web service application is further instrumented with the one or more supplementary candidate operations.
