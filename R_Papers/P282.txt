Approximate oracles and synergy in software energy search spaces
There is a growing interest in using evolutionary computation to reduce software systems’ energy consumption by utilising techniques such as genetic improvement. However, efficient and effective evolutionary optimisation of software systems requires a better understanding of the energy search landscape. One important choice practitioners have is whether to preserve the system’s original output or permit approximation; each of which has its own search space characteristics. When output preservation is a hard constraint, we report that the maximum energy reduction achievable by evolutionary mutation is 2.69% (0.76% on average). By contrast, this figure increases dramatically to 95.60% (33.90% on average) when approximation is permitted, indicating the critical importance of approximate output quality assessment for effective evolutionary optimisation. We investigate synergy, a phenomenon that occurs when simultaneously applied evolutionary mutations produce a effect greater than their individual sum. Our results reveal that 12.0% of all joint code modifications produced such a synergistic effect though 38.5% produce an antagonistic interaction in which simultaneously applied mutations are less effective than when applied individually. This highlights the need for an evolutionary approach over more greedy alternatives.
