State extensions for java pathfinder
Java PathFinder (JPF) is an explicit-state model checker for Java programs. JPF implements a backtrackable Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that provides non-deterministic choices and control over thread scheduling. JPF is itself implemented in Java and runs on top of a host JVM. JPF represents the JVM state of the program being checked and performs three main operations on this state representation: bytecode execution, state backtracking, and state comparison. This paper summarizes four extensions that we have developed to the JPF state representation and operations. One extension provides a new functionality to JPF, and three extensions improve performance of JPF in various scenarios. Some of our code has already been included in publicly available JPF.
