Eliminating redundant interactions when testing computer software applications
Testing computer software applications includes comparing multiple execution paths associated with multiple interactions performed with a computer software application during execution of the computer software application in order to determine which of the execution paths are similar in accordance with a predefined similarity criterion, identifying a subset of the interactions whose associated execution paths are similar in accordance with the predefined similarity criterion, and performing fewer than all of the interactions in the subset with the computer software application during execution of the computer software application.
