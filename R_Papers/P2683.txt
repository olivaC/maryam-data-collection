Software analytics= sharing information
Software and its development generates an inordinate amount of data. Development activities such as check-ins, work items, bug reports, code reviews, and test executions are recorded in software repositories. User interactions that reflect how customers experience software are recorded in telemetry data, run-time traces, and log files and helps to track application and feature usage and expose performance and reliability. Software analytics takes this data and turns it into actionable insight to better inform decisions related to software. To a large extent, software analytics is about what we can learn and share about software. This include our own projects but also projects by others. Looking back at decades of research in empirical software engineering and mining software repositories, software analytics lets us share different things: insights, models, methods, and data. In this talk, I will present successful efforts from Microsoft and academia on software analytics and try to convince you that analytics is all about sharing information.
