Automatic correction of cryptographic application program interfaces
A computer system may identify a cryptographic application programming interface (API) call for a program. The cryptographic API call may include a first variable. The computer system may determine that the first variable is a static value. The computer system may tag the first variable. The computer system may determine that the cryptographic API call will be executed. The computer system may replace the first variable with a second variable during execution of the program. The computer system may execute the cryptographic API call with the second variable.
