A change management approach in product lines for use case-driven development and testing
In this paper, driven by industrial needs, we present a change management approach for product lines within the context of use case-driven development and testing. As part of the approach, we first provide a modeling method to support variability modeling in Product Line (PL) use case diagrams, specifications, and domain models, intentionally avoiding any reliance on feature models and thus avoiding unnecessary modeling and traceability overhead. Then, we introduce a use case-driven configuration approach based on the proposed modelling method to automatically generate Product Specific (PS) use case and domain models from the PL models and configuration decisions. Building on this, we provide a change impact analysis approach for evolving configuration decisions in PL use case models. In addition, we plan to develop a change impact analysis approach for evolving PL use case models and an automated regression test selection technique for evolving configuration decisions and PL models.
