Security enforcement in the presence of dynamic code loading
A method (and structure) for enforcing a security policy includes retrieving from a memory a program to be verified against a security policy and a security specification defining the security policy. A static program analysis is performed on the program, using a processor on a computer, to determine whether the program is compatible with the security specification. The program is rejected if the program is determined by the static program analysis as being incompatible with the security specification. If the program is determined during the static program analysis as compatible with the security specification under static analysis criteria, then building a call-graph representation of the program for use to evaluate any dynamically-loaded code during an execution of the program. Any paths, if any, of the call-graph representation that reach at least one policy-relevant operation is marked.
