Learning techniques for software verification and validationâ€“special track at ISoLA 2010
Learning techniques are used increasingly to improve software verification and validation activities. For example, automata learning techniques have been used for extracting behavioral models of software systems. Such models can serve as formal documentation of the software and they can be further verified using automated tools or used for model-based test case generation. Automata learning techniques have also been used for automating compositional verification and for building abstractions of software behavior in the context of symbolic or parameterized model checking. Furthermore, various machine-learning techniques have been used in fine-tuning heuristics used in constraint solving, in coming up with new abstraction techniques in the context of bounded model checking or shape analysis, in inferring invariants of parameterized systems, or in classifying data in black box testing.
