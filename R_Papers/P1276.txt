Event Analytics
The process analysis toolkit (PAT) integrates the expressiveness of state, event, time, and probability-based languages with the power of model checking. PAT is a self-contained reasoning system for system specification, simulation, and verification. PAT currently supports a wide range of 12 different expressive modeling languages with many application domains and has attracted thousands of registered users from hundreds of organizations. In this invited talk, we will present the PAT system and its vision on “Event Analytics” (EA) which is beyond “Data Analytics”. The EA research is based on applying model checking to event planning, scheduling, prediction, strategy analysis and decision making. Various new EA research directions will be discussed.
