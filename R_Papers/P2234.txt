Eliminating false reports of security vulnerabilities when testing computer software
A system for eliminating false reports of security vulnerabilities when testing computer software, including a taint analysis engine configured to identify a tainted variable v in a computer application, a data mapping identification engine configured to identify a variable x within the application that holds data derived from v, where x is in a different format than v, an AddData identification engine configured to identify an AddData operation within the application that is performed on x, a signature identification engine configured to identify a Sign operation within the application that is performed on the results of the AddData operation on x, a signature comparison identification engine configured to identify an operation within the application that compares the results of the Sign operation with another value.
