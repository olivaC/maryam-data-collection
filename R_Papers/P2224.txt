Formal analysis of the quality and conformance of information flow downgraders
Mechanisms for evaluating downgrader code in application code with regard to one or more security guidelines are provided. Downgrader code in application code is identified, where the downgrader code is a portion of code in the application code that operates on an information flow of the application code to ensure confidentiality of information input to the downgrader code, in the output of the downgrader code. Processes of the downgrader code are evaluated against security guidelines to determine if the processes violate the security guidelines. A notification is generated in response to the evaluation indicating that the processes of the downgrader code violate the security guidelines. The notification is output to a computing device for consideration.
