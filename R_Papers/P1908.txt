Towards testing future web applications
The current Web applications are in continuous evolution to provide new and more complex functionalities, which can improve the user experience by means of adaptivity and dynamic changes. Since testing is the most frequently used technique to evaluate the quality of software applications in industry, novel testing approaches will be necessary to evaluate the quality of future (and more complex) web applications. In this paper, we investigate the testing challenges of future web applications and propose a testing methodology that addresses these challenges by the integration of search-based testing, model-based testing, oracle learning, concurrency testing, combinatorial testing, regression testing, and coverage analysis. This paper also presents a testing metamodel that states testing concepts and their relationships, which are used as the theoretical basis of the proposed testing methodology.
