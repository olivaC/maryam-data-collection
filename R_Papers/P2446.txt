PARBLO: Page-allocation-based DRAM row buffer locality optimization
DRAM row buffer conflicts can increase memory access latency significantly. This paper presents a new page-allocation-based optimization that works seamlessly together with some existing hardware and software optimizations to eliminate significantly more row buffer conflicts. Validation in simulation using a set of selected scientific and engineering benchmarks against a few representative memory controller optimizations shows that our method can reduce row buffer miss rates by up to 76% (with an average of 37.4%). This reduction in row buffer miss rates will be translated into performance speedups by up to 15% (with an average of 5%).
