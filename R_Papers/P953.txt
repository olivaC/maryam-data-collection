Systematic Software Testing: The Korat Approach
At ISSTA 2002, the three authors (then Ph.D. students) published the paper “Korat: Automated Testing Based on Java Predicates”, which won one of the first ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished paper awards. In 2012, the paper won the ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award. The authors briefly recount the motivation behind Korat research, the ideas pre- sented in the original paper, and some work it inspired.
