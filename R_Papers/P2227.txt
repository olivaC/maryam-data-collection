Static analysis based on observed string values during execution of a computer-based software application
Improving static analysis precision by recording a value pointed to by a string variable within the computer-based software application during the execution of a computer-based software application, modeling an invariant based on the recorded value, where the invariant represents at least one possible value pointed to by the string variable, performing a first static analysis of the computer-based software application to determine whether the invariant is valid with respect to the computer-based software application, and seeding a second static analysis of the computer-based software application with the invariant if the invariant is valid with respect to the computer-based software application.
