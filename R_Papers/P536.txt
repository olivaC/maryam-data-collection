Automated traceability analysis for UML model refinements
During iterative, UML-based software development, various UML diagrams, modeling the same system at different levels of abstraction are developed. These models must remain consistent when changes are performed. In this context, we refine the notion of impact analysis and distinguish horizontal impact analysis–that focuses on changes and impacts at one level of abstraction–from vertical impact analysis–that focuses on changes at one level of abstraction and their impacts on another level. Vertical impact analysis requires that some traceability links be established between model elements at the two levels of abstraction. We propose a traceability analysis approach for UML 2.0 class diagrams which is based on a careful formalization of changes to those models, refinements which are composed of those changes, and traceability links corresponding to refinements. We show how actual refinements and corresponding traceability links are formalized using the OCL. Tool support and a case study are also described.
