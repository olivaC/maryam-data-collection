Evosuite at the second unit testing tool competition
EvoSuite is a mature research prototype implementing a search-based approach to unit test generation for Java classes. It has been successfully run on a variety of different Java projects in the past, and after winning the first instance of the unit testing tool competition at SBSTâ€™13, it has also taken part in the second run. This paper reports on the obstacles and challenges encountered during the latter competition.
