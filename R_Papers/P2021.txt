Application Modification
Techniques for modifying an application are described herein. In some examples, a method includes generating, via a processor, a representation of an application and detecting a flow of data in the representation of the application based on static analysis. The method can also include detecting a predetermined property to be verified, the predetermined property comprising a source point in the representation of the application and a sink point in the representation of the application. In addition, the method can include detecting that the flow of data violates the predetermined property. Furthermore, the method can include selecting a set of changes to the representation of the application that prevents the violation of the predetermined property and modifying the application based on the selected set of changes
