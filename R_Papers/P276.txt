Time travel debugging in managed runtime
Various technologies described herein pertain to time travel debugging in a managed runtime system. The managed runtime system can include an execution component that executes a managed program component. Moreover, the managed runtime system can include a time travel debugger component. The time travel debugger component can be configured to record a sequence of live-object snapshots of program states during execution of the managed program component. A live-object snapshot can include live objects from a heap in memory at a given time during the execution. Moreover, the time travel debugger component can be configured to replay at least a portion of the execution of the managed program component based upon the live-object snapshots.
