Detecting security vulnerabilities on computing devices
Optimizing automated interactions with web pages by identifying, for each of multiple web pages, path information including an incoming hyperlink path having at least one hyperlink, where the incoming hyperlink path leads to the web page, and/or an outgoing hyperlink path having at least one hyperlink, where the outgoing hyperlink path emanates from the web page, determining whether the path information of each of the web pages meets a similarity condition, excluding from an interaction set of the web pages any of the web pages whose path information meets the similarity condition, and causing an automated interaction to be performed with any of the web pages in the interaction set.
