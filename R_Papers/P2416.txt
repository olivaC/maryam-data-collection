The State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, PRC
The State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites (SKLMMC) was established and passed the assessment in 1991, and was open in 1992. After years of development, the laboratory has become China's major base for composite materials research, which is mainly of metal matrix composites and the comprehensive development of polymer matrix composites and new functional composite materials. There are 72 regular research personnels, including 43 professors (researchers), 22 associate professors (senior engineers), among which 59 persons have Ph.D. degree. There are one academician of the Academy of Sciences, five winners of National Outstanding Youth Foundation and six Cheung Kong Chair Professors of Ministry of Education. The objective of laboratory is led by the high science and technology national defenses demand and important demand in fields of great significance. Fundamental and application researches are done on the advanced composites. For the fundamental researches, key theoretical and principal technical supports are provided. For the application researches, small batches and multi-kinds of materials are fabricated for both fields of great significance and civil application.
