Connecting and Serving the Software Engineering Community
FOR more than four decades TSE has served as one of the most highly regarded archival venues in the field of software engineering. The standards that the community of editors and reviewers has established and that authors have met make TSE a journal where one can reliably find well-presented reports on novel, impactful and wellvalidated results. While archival journal publication has great value, ultimately the role of TSE is to serve and connect the growing international community of software engineering researchers and practitioners. I know that TSE has served my colleagues and me by exposing us to ideas from researchers around the world. TSE has also helped me to establish personal connections and collaborationsâ€”a paper is a great conversation starter. In 2015 we made two steps to enhance the service and connections that TSE provides.
