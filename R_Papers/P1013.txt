Detecting concurrency errors in client-side java script web applications
As web technologies have evolved, the complexity of dynamic web applications has increased significantly and web applications suffer concurrency errors due to unexpected orders of interactions among web browsers, users, the network, and so forth. In this paper, we present WAVE (Web Applications Virtual Environment), a testing framework to detect concurrency errors in client-side web applications written in JavaScript. WAVE generates various sequences of operations as test cases for a web application and executes a sequence of operations by dynamically controlling interactions of a target web application with the execution environment. We demonstrate that WAVE is effective and efficient for detecting concurrency errors through experiments on eight examples and five non-trivial real-world web applications.
