Partition-based static analysis of computer software applications
Partition-based static analysis of computer software applications may include inspecting each of a plurality of modules of a computer software application to identify at least one dependency of the inspected module on at least one other module of the computer software application, for each of the inspected modules, determining any transitive dependencies of the inspected module from the dependencies identified for the inspected module, performing a first static analysis on one of the inspected modules and its transitive dependencies, and performing a second static analysis on another of the inspected modules and its transitive dependencies, where the first and second analyses may be performed independently from each other.
