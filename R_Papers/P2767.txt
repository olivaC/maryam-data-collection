Towards the next generation of bug tracking systems
Developers typically rely on the information submitted by end-users to resolve bugs. We conducted a survey on information needs and commonly faced problems with bug reporting among several hundred developers and users of the APACHE, ECLIPSE and MOZILLA projects. In this paper, we present the results of a card sort on the 175 comments sent back to us by the responders of the survey. The card sort revealed several hurdles involved in reporting and resolving bugs, which we present in a collection of recommendations for the design of new bug tracking systems. Such systems could provide contextual assistance, reminders to add information, and most important, assistance to collect and report crucial information to developers.
