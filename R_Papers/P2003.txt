UTILIZING LIKELY INVARIANTS FOR RUNTIME PROTECTION OF WEB SERVICES
An exemplary method for use with an application includes: testing the application with a set of security payloads to produce a set of execution traces, wherein testing the application with a given one of the set of security payloads produces a corresponding one of the set of execution traces; determining a set of candidate points comprising at least one candidate point for each of the set of security payloads, wherein a candidate point for the given one of the set of security payloads is determined based on the corresponding one of the set of execution traces; inferring a set of trust boundaries based on the determined set of candidate points; computing one or more possible transition points across the inferred set of trust boundaries; and instrumenting the application with a security defense at each of the computed possible transition points across the inferred set of trust boundaries.
