Refactoring programs for flexible locking
Disclosed is a novel computer implemented system, on demand service, computer program product and a method that provides a set of lock usages that improves concurrency resulting in execution performance of the software application by reducing lock contention through refactoring. More specifically, disclosed is a method to refactor a software application. The method starts with accessing at least a portion of a software application that can execute in an operating environment where there are more two or more threads of execution. Next, a determination is made if there is at least one lock used in the software application to enforce limits on accessing a resource. In response to determining that there is a lock with a first type of construct with a given set of features, the software application is refactored with the lock to preserve behavior of the software application.
