Techniques to identify idiomatic code in a code base
Techniques to identify idiomatic code in a code base are described. Embodiments of such techniques are configured with idiom information corresponding to idiomatic code representations of computer code of which each idiomatic code representation comprises information corresponding to a control structure and variable usage. These techniques are operative to compare the idiomatic code representations to computer code fragments in the code base and identify one or more code fragments matching at least one of the idiomatic code representations. These techniques may identify functional operators for replacing the code fragments in the code base. Other embodiments are described and claimed.
