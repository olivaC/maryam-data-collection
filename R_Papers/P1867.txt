FITTEST: A new continuous and automated testing process for future Internet applications
Since our society is becoming increasingly dependent on applications emerging on the Future Internet, quality of these applications becomes a matter that cannot be neglected. However, the complexity of the technologies involved in Future Internet applications makes testing extremely challenging. The EU FP7 FITTEST project has addressed some of these challenges by developing and evaluating a Continuous and Integrated Testing Environment that monitors a Future Internet application when it runs such that it can automatically adapt the testware to the dynamically changing behaviour of the application.
