Synthesis of Randomized Accuracy-Aware Map-Fold Programs
We present Syndy, a technique for automatically synthesizing randomized map/fold computations that trade accuracy for performance. Given a specification of a fully accurate computation, Syndy automatically synthesizes approximate implementations of map and fold tasks, explores the approximate computation space that these approximations induce, and derives an accuracy versus performance tradeoff curve that characterizes the explored space. Each point on the curve corresponds to an approximate randomized program configuration that realizes the probabilistic error and time bounds associated with that point.
