Reverse Engineering Android Apps With CodeInspect
Abstract While the Android operating system is popular among users, it has also attracted a broad variety of miscreants and malware. New samples are discovered every day. Purely automatic analysis is often not enough for understanding current state-of-the-art Android malware, though. Miscreants obfuscate and encrypt their code, or hide secrets in native code. Precisely identifying the malware's behavior and finding information about its potential authors requires tools that assist human experts in a manual investigation. In this paper, we present CodeInspect, a novel reverse engineering tool for Android app that optimally supports investigators and analysts in that task.
