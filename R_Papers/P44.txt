How current android malware seeks to evade automated code analysis
First we report on a new threat campaign, underway in Korea, which infected around 20,000 Android users within two months. The campaign attacked mobile users with malicious applications spread via different channels, such as email attachments or SMS spam. A detailed investigation of the Android malware resulted in the identification of a new Android malware family Android/BadAccents. The family represents current state-of-the-art in mobile malware development for banking trojans.Second, we describe in detail the techniques this malware family uses and confront them with current state-of-the-art static and dynamic code-analysis techniques for Android applications. We highlight various challenges for automatic malware analysis frameworks that significantly hinder the fully automatic detection of malicious components in current Android malware. Furthermore, the malware exploits a previously unknown tapjacking vulnerability in the Android operating system, which we describe. As a result of this work, the vulnerability, affecting all Android versions, will be patched in one of the next releases of the Android Open Source Project.
