Fite: future integrated testing environment
It is well known that the later software errors are discovered during the development process, the more costly they are to repair, yet testing and automated analysis tools tend to be applied late in the development cycle. In this paper, we describe a future integrated testing environment (FITE) that continually analyzes code for a variety of functional and nonfunctional properties to provide developer feedback as code is being written. This instant feedback allows developers to fix errors as they are introduced, increasing developer productivity and software quality.
