Optimising darwinian data structures on google guava
Data structure selection and tuning is laborious but can vastly improve application performance and memory footprint. In this paper, we demonstrate how artemis, a multiobjective, cloud-based optimisation framework can automatically find optimal, tuned data structures and how it is used for optimising the Guava library. From the proposed solutions that artemis found,   27.45%  of them improve all measures (execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption). More specifically, artemis managed to improve the memory consumption of Guava by up 13%, execution time by up to 9%, and 4% CPU usage.
