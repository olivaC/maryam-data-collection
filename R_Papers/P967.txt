Specification-based program repair using SAT
Removing bugs in programs – even when location of faulty statements is known – is tedious and error-prone, particularly because of the increased likelihood of introducing new bugs as a result of fixing known bugs. We present an automated approach for generating likely bug fixes using behavioral specifications. Our key insight is to replace a faulty statement that has deterministic behavior with one that has nondeterministic behavior, and to use the specification constraints to prune the ensuing nondeterminism and repair the faulty statement. As an enabling technology, we use the SAT-based Alloy tool-set to describe specification constraints as well as for solving them. Initial experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in repairing programs that manipulate structurally complex data. We believe specification-based automated debugging using SAT holds much promise.
