Hybrid analysis of vulnerable information flows
Arrangements described herein relate to analyzing vulnerable information flows in an application. A black-box scan of the application can be performed to record a call-tree representation of call stacks arising in the application due to test inputs provided during the black-box scan. For each path in the call-tree representation that does not constitute a vulnerable information flow during the black-box scan, a static analysis can be performed to determine at least one parameter value that, when abstracted, drives execution of the application, via the path, to flow to the at least one security sink. A security report can be generated identifying at least one of the paths in the call-tree representation that does not constitute the vulnerable information flow during the black-box scan, but flows to the at least one security sink when the at least one parameter value is abstracted.
