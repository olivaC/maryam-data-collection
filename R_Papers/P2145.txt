Scalable and precise string analysis using index-sensitive static string abstractions
A disclosed method includes accessing one or more seeding specifications and a program including computer-readable code and applying the one or more seeding specifications to the program to identify for analysis seeds including strings for corresponding identified string variables. The method includes tracking flows emanating from the identified seeds. The tracking includes computing an integral offset into a tracked string variable for any statements causing such a computation. The tracking also includes providing a string representation based on the computed integral offset, wherein the provided string representation comprises a value of the integral offset and an indication of the corresponding tracked string variable. The tracking further includes modeling string manipulations of the tracked string variables using the string representations. Apparatus and program products are also disclosed.
