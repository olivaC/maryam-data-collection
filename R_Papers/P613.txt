Runtime verification of web service interface contracts
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) is a collection of technologies used to develop rich and interactive Web applications. A typical Ajax client runs locally in the user's Web browser and refreshes its interface on the fly in response to user input. Using this method with the AWS-ECS let us automatically generate test sequences and detect two deviations of their service implementation with respect to the online documentation provided, in less than three minutes of testing. We also provided a framework that allows the runtime monitoring of both client and server contract constraints with minimal modification to an existing Ajax application code. Experiments with the Amazon E-Commerce Service demonstrate the advantages of using a model-based approach for the runtime testing and monitoring of Web applications.
