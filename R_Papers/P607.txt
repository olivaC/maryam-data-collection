Software for everyone by everyone
Given the dizzying pace of change in computer science, trying to look too far into the future of software engineering is hard. However, it might be possible to predict the future of software for the next decade based on the current trends. And based on the predictions on future of software, it might be possible to speculate about the future of software engineering. I try to do such a prediction in this position paper. I predict that the future of software will be applications that will be accessible everywhere, such as web applications and mobile applications. I also predict that increasingly more applications will be developed by non-computer-scientists. The challenges and the opportunities for software engineering research will be in providing tools and techniques that will enable non-programmers to become programmers for everywhere-accessible-software.
