Test Generation and Test Prioritization for Simulink Models with Dynamic Behavior
All engineering disciplines are founded and rely on models, although they may differ on purposes and usages of modeling. Among the different disciplines, the engineering of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) particularly relies on models with dynamic behaviors (i.e., models that exhibit time-varying changes). The Simulink modeling platform greatly appeals to CPS engineers since it captures dynamic behavior models. It further provides seamless support for two indispensable engineering activities: (1) automated verification of abstract system models via model simulation, and (2) automated generation of system implementation via code generation.
