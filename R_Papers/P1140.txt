Modeling Approach Comparison Criteria for the CMA@ RE Workshop at REâ€™2013
The Fourth International Comparing Modeling Approaches (CMA) workshop continues the work begun at CMA workshops held at previous MODELS conferences, Requirements Engineering (RE) 2013, and previous Bellairs Workshops. The Bellairs workshops produced a focused case study suitable for modeling in its entirety based on a Crisis Management System case study, and a preliminary collection of criteria to compare aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) approaches along with more traditional object-oriented modeling (OOM) approaches. Each CMA workshop has produced a revised set of criteria along with evaluations of additional modeling approaches that have broadened the modeling paradigms beyond the initial scope of AOM and OOM. The 2013 edition of the CMA workshop at MODELS (CMA@MODELS'13) will bring together practitioners of different modeling approaches with the following two aims in mind: to continue applying the comparison criteria to more modeling approaches in the context of the focused case study, and to propose and execute analyses of the existing results, with the end goal of enabling practitioners to propose and evaluate end-to-end methodologies.
