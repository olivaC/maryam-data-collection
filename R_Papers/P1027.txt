A Case Study of the Application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution to Real-World Binary Programs
Analyzing binary programs is necessary in many situations when we do not have the programs source code. In recent years, many binary analysis tools have been developed such as CodeSurfer/x86, BitBlaze and S2E. In this paper we developed a binary symbolic execution engine based on BitBlaze. We applied the engine to generate hundreds of test cases for a realworld application on Windows: Acrobat Reader. Besides, we also discussed lessons learned from applying dynamic symbolic execution on real-world programs.
