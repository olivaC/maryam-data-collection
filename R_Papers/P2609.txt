Replaying and isolating failing multi-object interactions
When a program fails, there are typically multiple objects that contribute to the failure. Our JINSI tool automatically captures the failure-causing interaction between objects and isolates a sequence of calls that all are relevant for reproducing the failure. In contrast to existing work, JINSI also isolates relevant interaction within the observed component and thus across all layers of a complex application. In a proof of concept, JINSI has successfully isolated the interaction for a failure of the COLUMBA e-mail client, pinpointing the defect: "Out of the 187,532 interactions in the addressbook component, two incoming calls suffice to reproduce the failure."
