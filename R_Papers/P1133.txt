PLEDGE: a product line editor and test generation tool
Specific requirements of clients lead to the development of variants of the same software. These variants form a Software Product Line (SPL). Ideally, testing a SPL involves testing all the software products that can be configured through the combination of features. This, however, is intractable in practice since a) large SPLs can lead to millions of possible software variants and b) the testing process is usually limited by budget and time constraints. To overcome this problem, this paper introduces PLEDGE, an open source tool that selects and prioritizes the product configurations maximizing the feature interactions covered. The uniqueness of PLEDGE is that it bypasses the computation of the feature interactions, allowing to scale to large SPLs.
