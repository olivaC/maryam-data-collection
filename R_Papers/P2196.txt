Selective data flow analysis of bounded regions of computer software applications
Performing data flow analysis of a computer software application, including, for a data flow analysis type, identifying within a computer software application code base a plurality of seeds relating to the data flow analysis type, for each of the plurality of seeds, defining a portion of the computer software application code base to a predefined depth of calls backward from the seed and to a predefined depth of calls forward from the seed, thereby resulting in a plurality of bounded portions of the computer software application code base, detecting a change in the computer software application code base, and performing, on any of the bounded portions affected by the change, a data flow analysis relating to the data flow analysis type.
