FOO: A Minimal Modern OO Calculus
We present the Flyweight Object-Oriented (FOO) calculus for the modeling of object-oriented languages. FOO is a simple, minimal class-based calculus, modeling only essential computational aspects and emphasizing larger-scale features (e.g., inheritance and generics). FOO is motivated by the observation that recent language design work focuses on elements not well-captured either by traditional object calculi or by language-specific modeling efforts, such as Featherweight Java. FOO integrates seamlessly both nominal and structural subtyping ideas, leveraging the latter to eliminate the need for modeling object fields and constructors. Comparing to recent formalization efforts in the literature, FOO is more compact, yet versatile enough to be usable in multiple settings modeling Java, C#, or Scala extensions.
