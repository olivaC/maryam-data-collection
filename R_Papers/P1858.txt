A Multi-objective Approach to Business Process Repair
Business process model repair aims at updating an existing model so as to accept deviant (e.g., new) behaviours, while remaining as close as possible to the initial model. In this paper, we present a multi-objective approach to process model repair, which maximizes the behaviours accepted by the repaired model while minimizing the cost associated with the repair operations. Given the repair operations for full process repair, we formulate the associated multi-objective problem in terms of a set of pseudo-Boolean constraints. In order to evaluate our approach, we have applied it to a case study from the Public Administration domain. Results indicate that it provides business analysts with a selection of good and tunable alternative solutions.
