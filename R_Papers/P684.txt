System, method, and apparatus for modular, string-sensitive, access rights analysis with demand-driven precision
A static analysis for identification of permission-requirements on stack-inspection authorization systems is provided. The analysis employs functional modularity for improved scalability. To enhance precision, the analysis utilizes program slicing to detect the origin of each parameter passed to a security-sensitive function. Furthermore, since strings are essential when defining permissions, the analysis integrates a sophisticated string analysis that models string computations.
