Comparing six modeling approaches
While there are many aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) approaches, from requirements to low-level design, it is still difficult to compare them and know under which conditions different approaches are most applicable. This comparison, however, is crucially important to unify existing AOM and more traditional object-oriented modeling (OOM) approaches and to generalize individual approaches into a comprehensive end-to-end method. Such a method does not yet exist. This paper reports on work done at the inaugural Comparing Modeling Approaches (CMA) workshop towards the goal of identifying potential comprehensive methodologies: (i) a common, focused case study for six modeling approaches, (ii) a set of criteria applied to each of the six approaches, and (iii) the assessment results.
