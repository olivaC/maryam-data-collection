An Implementation of the Active Contours without Edges model and the Logic Framework for Active contours on multi-channel images
In this project, we provide an implementation for the Chan-Vese model for active contours without edges, and the Sandberg-Chan logic framework for active contours on multi-channel images. The Chan-Vese model is a special case of the more general Mumford-Shah functional for segmentation and level sets. It differs from other active contour models in that it is not edge dependent, therefore it is more capable of detecting objects whose boundaries may not be defined by a gradient (e.g. blurry images, noisy images). The Sandberg-Chan model builds on top of the Chan-Vese model by allowing the contour to evolve simultaneously on multiple channels. It also offers a set of logic operations that can be applied to those channels (union, intersection, complement, and their combinations). We evaluate our implementation based on several criteria, such as: independence of initial curve position, successful detection of holes, performance with blurred and noisy images, and response to scaling parameters.
