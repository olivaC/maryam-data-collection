Symbolic Execution
Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in symbolic execution for software testing, due to its ability to generate high-coverage test suites and find deep errors in complex software applications. In this tutorial, we give an overview of modern symbolic execution techniques, discuss their key challenges in terms of path exploration, constraint solving, and memory modeling, and present several tools implementing these techniques.
