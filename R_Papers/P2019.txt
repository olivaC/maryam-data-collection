Customizing a security report using static analysis
A control graph representing a model of data flow of a computer program can be generated during a static analysis. Respective edge weights can be assigned to edges of a plurality of paths in the control flow graph. A size of the uniform-cost search method can be dynmically configured based on a size of the control flow graph. A total edge weight for the considered paths can be determined based the edge weights assigned to the respective edges of the considered path. At least one path of the considered paths in the control flow graph whose total edge weight satisfies a particular total edge weight criteria can be identified. The control flow graph can be updated to indicate to a user the at least one path in the control flow graph whose total edge weight satisfies the particular total edge weight criteria.
