StateComparator: Detecting Unbounded Variables Using JPF
Model checking software applications can result in exploring large or infinite state spaces. It is thus essential to identify and abstract variables that could potentially take on a large number of values, in order to increase state matching. In this paper we describe a tool we created as an extension to Java PathFinder, called State-Comparator, which compares states in the state space to identify variables that should be abstracted.
