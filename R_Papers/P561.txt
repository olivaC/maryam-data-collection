Differential String Analysis and Repair
Effectiveness of policy-based bug detection and repair that we presented in previous chapter depends on the correctness and precision of the written policies in characterizing good and bad string values. It is often possible, for instance, to encode well-known attacks into security policies (in the form of attack patterns) and write down policies for common input fields such as email address and zip code. In other cases, however, the checks to be performed on the inputs are specific to the functionality of the web application, and the input validation may be tightly coupled with and dependent on the application logic. Because they are specific to individual applications, there are no pre-specified policies that can be used to assess these types of input checks. In these cases, to make sure that the input validation is adequate, it would be necessary to specify a different policy for each different application, which is a tedious and error-prone task.
