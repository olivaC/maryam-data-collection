Detecting multistep operations when interacting with web applications
Detecting multistep operations when interacting with web applications is performed by identifying a set of multiple web pages of a web application, where the web pages in the set of multiple web pages are sequentially navigable, identifying a group of multiple web page elements at the same relative location in each of the web pages in the set of multiple web pages, determining that the identified groups of web page elements are similar to each other in accordance with a predefined similarity criterion, identifying an element that is common to each identified group of web page elements, and determining that a characteristic of the element is uniquely varied in each of the identified groups of web page elements.
