DETECTING ATTACKS BY MATCHING OF ACCESS FREQUENCIES AND SEQUENCES IN DIFFERENT SOFTWARE LAYERS
A number of events are counted in different layers of a computing environment during execution of a software application. The number of counted events can be compared to a previously generated cluster set to determine that at least one of the counted events is an outlier. Data can then be provided that characterizes the at least one of the counted events determined to be an outlier. In some cases, some or all of the functionality of the software application can be selectively disabled. Related apparatus, systems, techniques and articles are also described.
