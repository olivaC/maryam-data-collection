Cooperative Aspect Oriented Programming for executable business processes
AO4BPEL applied Aspect Oriented Programming to executable business processes. Although modularized, AO4BPEL aspects do not have an explicit interface and the implicit one, based on XPath, is often fragile, hence reusing aspects in different processes is quite hard. Cooperative Aspect Oriented Programming aims at making aspects reusable by means of cooperative work between base code and aspects, realized by increasing the explicit awareness of aspects at the expense of pure obliviousness. This work investigates the use of Cooperative Aspect Oriented Programming with BPEL processes.
