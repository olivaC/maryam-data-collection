Clara: Partially evaluating runtime monitors at compile time
Abstract Clara is a novel static-analysis framework for partially evaluating finite-state runtime  monitors at compile time. Clara uses static typestate analyses to automatically convert any  AspectJ monitoring aspect into a residual runtime monitor that only monitors events  triggered by program locations that the analyses failed to prove safe. If the static analysis  succeeds on all locations, this gives strong static guarantees. If not, the efficient residual  runtime monitor is guaranteed to capture property violations at runtime. Researchers can  use Clara with most runtime-monitoring tools that implement monitors as AspectJ aspects. In  this tutorial supplement, we provide references to related reading material that will allow the  reader to obtain in-depth knowledge about the context in which Clara can be applied and  about the techniques that underlie the Clara framework.
