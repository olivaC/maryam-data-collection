Automated testing of hybrid Simulink/Stateflow controllers: industrial case studies
We present the results of applying our approach for testing Simulink controllers to one public and one proprietary model, both industrial. Our approach combines explorative and exploitative search algorithms to visualize the controller behavior over its input space and to identify test scenarios in the controller input space that violate or are likely to violate the controller requirements. The engineers' feedback shows that our approach is easy to use in practice and gives them confidence about the behavior of their models.
