Boomerang: Demand-Driven Flow-and Context-Sensitive Pointer Analysis for Java (Artifact)
Evaluating pointer analyses with respect to soundness and precision has been a tedious task. Within this artifact we present PointerBench, the benchmark suite used in the paper to compare the pointer analysis Boomerang with two other demand-driven pointer analyses, SB [Sridharan and Bodik, 2006] and DA [Yan et al., 2011]. We show PointerBench can be used to test different pointer analyses. In addition to that, the artifact contains usage examples for Boomerang on simple test programs. The test programs and the input on these programs to Boomerang can be changed to experiment with the algorithm and its features. Additionally, the artifact contains the integration of Boomerang, SB, and DA into FlowDroid, which can then be executed on arbitrary Android applications.
