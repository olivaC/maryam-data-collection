Scratchpad memory aware task scheduling with minimum number of preemptions on a single processor
We propose a unified approach to the problem of scheduling a set of tasks with individual release times, deadlines and precedence constraints, and allocating the data of each task to the SPM (Scratchpad Memory) on a single processor system. Our approach consists of a task scheduling algorithm and an SPM allocation algorithm. The former constructs a feasible schedule incrementally, aiming to minimize the number of preemptions in the feasible schedule. The latter allocates a portion of the SPM to each task in an efficient way by employing a novel data structure, namely, the preemption graph. We have evaluated our approach and a previous approach by using six task sets. The results show that our approach achieves up to 20.31% on WCRT (Worst-Case Response Time) reduction over the previous approach.
