Mitigating security risks via code movement
A method includes performing on a computing system a source-to-sink reachability analysis of code of an application. The reachability analysis is performed using a static analysis of the code and determines flows from sources of information to sinks that use the information. The method includes determining scopes for corresponding security sensitive operations using the determined flows, each of the security sensitive operations corresponding to statements in the code and one or more flows. A scope for a security sensitive operation includes a block of statements in the code that correspond to a set of one or more flows ending at a sink. The method includes, for each of one or more selected scopes, moving statements in a corresponding block of statements that are independent of a security sensitive operation in the block to code before or after the block. Apparatus and program products are also disclosed.
