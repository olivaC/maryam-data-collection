String Analysis for Vulnerability Detection and Repair
String manipulation errors in input validation and sanitization code are a common source for security vulnerabilities in web applications. This short survey summarizes the string analysis techniques we developed that can automatically identify and repair such vulnerabilities. Our approach (1) extracts client- and server-side input validation and sanitization functions, (2) models them as deterministic finite automata (DFA) using symbolic fixpoint computations, and (3) identifies errors in input validation and sanitization code by either checking them with respect to manually specified attack patterns, or by identifying inconsistencies in input validation and sanitization operations at the client and server-side. Furthermore, we developed automated repair techniques that strengthen the input validation and sanitization checks in order to eliminate identified vulnerabilities. We implemented these techniques in two tools: Stranger (STRing AutomatoN GEneratoR) and SemRep (SEMantic differential REPair), which are available at: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~vlab/tools.html. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that these techniques are very promising: when applied to a set of real-world web applications, our techniques are able to automatically identify a large number of security vulnerabilities and repair them.
