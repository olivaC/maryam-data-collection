Generating texture of images using efficient numerical analysis technique
This paper proposes an algorithm for generating texture for any image based on the Bezier surfaces and control point polygons in 3D. Such approach forms the basis of Computer Aided Geometric Designs (CAGD) along with other important techniques. Our proposed procedure generates a pattern by performing interpolation techniques using control points on Bezier curves and surfaces, unlike most of the other procedures that use CAGD built in toolbox. The advantage of our research paper is that is can play an important role in future research as it provides concrete step by step procedure to generate texture on images. Moreover, results of our approach are shown through simulations.
