Codebender: a tool for remote software protection using orthogonal replacement
CodeBender implements a novel client replacement strategy to counter the malicious host problem and address the problem of guaranteeing client-code security. CodeBender is a tool that implements a novel client-replacement strategy to counter the malicious host problem. It works by limiting the client code's validity and, when the code expires, by having the server provide a new client that replaces the former one. The complexity of analyzing frequently changing, always different (orthogonal) program code deters an adversary's reverse engineering efforts. We've implemented CodeBender and tested its practicability in two case studies.
