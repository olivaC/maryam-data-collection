Collaborative specification of semantically annotated business processes
Semantic annotations are a way to provide a precise meaning to business process elements, which supports reasoning on properties and constraints. The specification and annotation of business processes is a complex activity involving different analysts possibly working on the same business process. In this paper we present a framework which aims at supporting business analysts in the collaborative specification and annotation of business processes. A shared workspace, theoretically grounded in a formal representation, allows to collaboratively manipulate processes, ontologies as well as constraints, while a dedicated tool enables to hide the complexity of the underlying formal representation to the users.
