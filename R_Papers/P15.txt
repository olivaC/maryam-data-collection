VISUFLOW: a Debugging Environment for Static Analyses
Code developers in industry frequently use static analysis tools to detect and x software defects in their code. But what about defects in the static analyses themselves? While debugging application code is a dicult, time-consuming task, debugging a static analysis is even harder. We have surveyed 115 static analysis writers to determine what makes static analysis dicult to debug, and to identify which debugging features would be desirable for static analysis. Based on this information, we have created Visuflow, a debugging environment for static data-ow analysis. Visuflow is built as an Eclipse plugin, and supports analyses written on top of the program analysis framework Soot. The dierent components in Visuflow provide analysis writers with visualizations of the internal computations of the analysis, and actionable debugging features to support debugging static analyses. A video demo of Visuflow is available online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkEfBDwiuH4
