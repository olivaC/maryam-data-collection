Extending SysML with AADL concepts for comprehensive system architecture modeling
Recent years have seen a proliferation of languages for describing embedded systems. Some of these languages have emerged from domain-specific frameworks, and some are adaptions or extensions of more general-purpose languages. In this paper, we focus on two widely-used standard languages: the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). AADL was born as an avionics-focused domain-specific language and later on has been revised to represent and support a more general category of embedded real-time systems. SysML is an extension of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) intended to support system engineering and modeling. We propose the ExSAM profile that extends SysML by adding AADL concepts to it with the goal of exploiting the key advantages of both languages in a seamless way. More precisely, by using ExSAM and any SysML modeling environment, we will be able to both model system engineering concepts and use AADL analysis tools where needed. We describe the ExSAM profile through several examples and compare it with existing alternatives. We have implemented ExSAM using IBM Rational Rhapsody and evaluated its completeness and usefulness through two case studies.
