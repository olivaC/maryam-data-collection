Polyglot: systematic analysis for multiple statechart formalisms
Polyglot is a tool for the systematic analysis of systems integrated from components built using multiple Statechart formalisms. In Polyglot, Statechart models are translated into a common Java representation with pluggable semantics for different Statechart variants. Polyglot is tightly integrated with the Java Pathfinder verification tool-set, providing analysis and test-case generation capabilities. The tool has been applied in the context of safety-critical software systems whose interacting components were modeled using multiple Statechart formalisms.
