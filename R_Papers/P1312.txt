Verification of functional and non-functional requirements of web service composition
Web services have emerged as an important technology nowadays. There are two kinds of requirements that are crucial to web service composition, which are functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements focus on functionality of the composed service, e.g., given a booking service, an example of functional requirements is that a flight ticket with price higher than $2000 will never be purchased. Non-functional requirements are concerned with the quality of service (QoS), e.g., an example of the booking serviceâ€™s non-functional requirements is that the service will respond to the user within 5 seconds. Non-functional requirements are important to web service composition, and are often an important clause in service-level agreements (SLAs). Even though the functional requirements are satisfied, a slow or unreliable service may still not be adopted. In our paper, we propose an automated approach to verify combined functional and non-functional requirements directly based on the semantics of web service composition. Our approach has been implemented and evaluated on the real-world case studies, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
