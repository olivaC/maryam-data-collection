Comparing paper ranking algorithms
The research presented in this paper focuses on comparing and evaluating various ranking algorithms that can be used on citation graphs in order to rank individual papers according to their importance and relevance. The graph analysis algorithms investigated in this paper are PageRank, CiteRank and an algorithm proposed by Hwang et al. and compared to the method of simply counting the number of citations of a publication. In addition, a new algorithm, NewRank, is proposed which is a combination of the PageRank and CiteRank algorithms with the focus on identifying influential papers that were published recently. A customizable crawler framework was developed to collect publication datasets from various sources. The development of this framework is discussed in detail. Finally, the ranking algorithms are evaluated against the list of the most influential papers compiled by the ICSE selection committee.
