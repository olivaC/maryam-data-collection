Databases on Future Hardware (Dagstuhl Seminar 17101)
A number of physical limitations mandate radical changes in the way how we build computing hard- and software, and there is broad consensus that a stronger interaction between hard- and software communities is needed to meet the ever-growing demand for application performance. Under this motivation, representatives from various hard- and software communities have met at the Dagstuhl seminar "Databases on Future Hardware" to discuss the implications in the context of database systems. The outcome of the seminar was not only a much better understanding of each other's needs, constraints, and ways of thinking. Very importantly, the group identified topic areas that seem key for the ongoing shift, together with suggestions on how the field could move forward. During the seminar, it turned out that the future of databases is not only a question of technology. Rather, economic considerations have to be taken into account when building next-generation database engines.
