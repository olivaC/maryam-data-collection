Auto-tuning program analysis tools using machine learning
Machine learning (ML) significantly reduces false alarms generated by an automated analysis tool performing static security analysis. Using either user-supplied or system-generated annotation of particular findings, a “hypothesis” is generated about how to classify other static analysis findings. The hypothesis is implemented as a machine learning classifier. To generate the classifier, a set of features are abstracted from a typical witness, and the system compares feature sets against one another to determine a set of weights for the classifier. The initial hypothesis is then validated against a second set of findings, and the classifier is adjusted as necessary based on how close it fits the new data. Once the approach converges on a final classifier, it is used to filter remaining findings in the report.
