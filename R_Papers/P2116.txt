Progressive black-box testing of computer software applications
Testing computer software applications by performing a first black-box test on a computer software application, identifying any instructions of the computer software application that were reached by a payload of the first black-box test, determining a degree of success of the first black-box test in accordance with predefined success criteria, determining whether any of the instructions that were reached by the payload changed after performing the first black-box test, deciding whether to perform a second black-box test on the computer software application, where the deciding whether to perform the second black-box test is based on whether any of the instructions that were reached by the payload of the first black-box test changed after performing the first black-box test, and the degree of success of the first black-box test.
