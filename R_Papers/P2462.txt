Mining Sandboxes
A technique to confine a computer program to computing resources accessed during automatic testing. Sandbox mining first explores software behavior by means of automatic test generation, and extracts the set of resources accessed during these tests. This set is then used as a sandbox, blocking access to resources not used during testing. The mined sandbox thus protects against behavior changes such as the activation of latent malware, infections, targeted attacks, or malicious updates. The use of test generation makes sandbox mining a fully automatic process that can be run by vendors and end users alike.
