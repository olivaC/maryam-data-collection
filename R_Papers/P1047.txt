Extracting Statistical Graph Features for Accurate and Efficient Time Series Classification
This paper presents a multiscale visibility graph representation for time series as well as feature extraction methods for time series classification (TSC). Unlike traditional TSC approaches that seek to find global similarities in time series databases (eg., Nearest Neighbor with Dynamic Time Warping distance) or methods specializing in locating local patterns/subsequences (eg., shapelets), we extract solely statistical features from graphs that are generated from time series. Specifically, we augment time series by means of their multiscale approximations, which are further transformed into a set of visibility graphs. After extracting probability distributions of small motifs, density, assortativity, etc., these features are used for building highly accurate classification models using generic classifiers (eg., Support Vector Machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting). Thanks to the way how we transform time series into graphs and extract features from them, we are able to capture both global and local features from time series. Based on extensive experiments on a large number of open datasets and comparison with five state-of-the-art TSC algorithms, our approach is shown to be both accurate and efficient: it is more accurate than Learning Shapelets and at the same time faster than Fast Shapelets.
