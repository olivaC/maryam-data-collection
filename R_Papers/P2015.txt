Detection of software or hardware incompatibilities in software packages
In an approach for determining compatibility between a computing device and a software application, a processor receives code of a software application. A processor generates a call graph for the software application using the code, wherein the call graph describes at least a first type of hardware component required to execute the software application. A processor identifies a set of one or more hardware components included within a computing device. A processor determines whether the computing device is compatible with the software application based on, at least, the call graph and the determined set of one or more hardware components included within the computing device.
