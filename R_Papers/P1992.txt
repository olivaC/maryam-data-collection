Semantic Privacy Enforcement
Providing an online defense mechanism against privacy threats by storing a database of facts and an abstractions database in a storage medium. The database of facts includes a plurality of private data fields comprising at least a first set of private data fields and a second set of private data fields. The abstractions database associates at least one respective field of the first set of private data fields with at least one corresponding field of the second set of private data fields. A request is received from a mobile application for a first private data value from the first set of private data fields. The abstractions database and the database of facts are used to identify a second private data value from the second set of data fields that is associated with the first private data value. A response is formulated for the request by providing the second private data value.
