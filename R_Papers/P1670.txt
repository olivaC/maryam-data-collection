An approach to testing commercial embedded systems
A wide range of commercial consumer devices such as mobile phones and smart televisions rely on embedded systems software to provide their functionality. Testing is one of the most commonly used methods for validating this software, and improved testing approaches could increase these devicesâ€™ dependability. In this article we present an approach for performing such testing. Our approach is composed of two techniques. The first technique involves the selection of test data; it utilizes test adequacy criteria that rely on dataflow analysis to distinguish points of interaction between specific layers in embedded systems and between individual software components within those layers, while also tracking interactions between tasks. The second technique involves the observation of failures: it utilizes a family of test oracles that rely on instrumentation to record various aspects of a system's execution behavior, and compare observed behavior to certain intended system properties that can be derived through program analysis. Empirical studies of our approach show that our adequacy criteria can be effective at guiding the creation of test cases that detect faults, and our oracles can help expose faults that cannot easily be found using typical output-based oracles. Moreover, the use of our criteria accentuates the fault-detection effectiveness of our oracles.
