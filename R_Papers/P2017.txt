Protecting an application via an intra-application firewall
One or more communication interfaces of a first application may be scanned. In response to the scanning, it may be determined that at least a first component of the first application is subject to public access from any application. One or more public access features associated with the first component may be removed, wherein the first component is no longer subject to public access from any application. A first module may be added to the first application to control access to data to or from the first component via one or more security rules.
