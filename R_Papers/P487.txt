An industrial application of robustness testing using aspect-oriented modeling, UML/MARTE, and search algorithms
Systematic and rigorous robustness testing is very critical for embedded systems, as for example communication and control systems. Robustness testing aims at testing the behavior of a system in the presence of faulty situations in its operating environment (e.g., sensors and actuators). In such situations, the system should gracefully degrade its performance instead of abruptly stopping execution. To systematically perform robustness testing, one option is to resort to model-based robustness testing (MBRT), based for example on UML/MARTE models. However, to successfully apply MBRT in industrial contexts, new technology needs to be developed to scale to the complexity of real industrial systems. In this paper, we report on our experience of performing MBRT on video conferencing systems developed by Cisco Systems, Norway. We discuss how we developed and integrated various techniques and tools to achieve a fully automated MBRT that is able to detect previously uncaught software faults in those systems. We provide an overview of how we achieved scalable modeling of robustness behavior using aspect-oriented modeling, test case generation using search algorithms, and environment emulation for test case execution. Our experience and lessons learned identify challenges and open research questions for the industrial application of MBRT.
