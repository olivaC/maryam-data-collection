Generating inputs for client-server programs for fault-detection and localization
The present invention provides a system, computer program product, and a computer implemented method for analyzing a set of two or more communicating applications. The method begins with receiving a first second application that communicates with each other during execution. Next, an initial input for executing the first application and the second application is received. The initial input is added to a set of inputs. An iterative execution loop is performed at least once. The loop begins with selecting inputs out of the set of inputs for execution. Next, using the selected inputs, the first and/or the second application is executed while information regarding the execution and information communicated to the other application are recorded. A set of one or more new application inputs for either applications is generated based the second application recorded information and the first application information. These new inputs are added to the set of inputs.
