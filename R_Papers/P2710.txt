Welcome to RSSE 2012
Recommendation systems for software engineering (RSSEs) are tools that help developers and managers to better cope with the huge amount of information faced in today's software projects. They provide developers with information to guide them in a number of activities (e.g., software navigation, debugging, refactoring), or to alert them of potential issues (e.g., conflicting changes, failure-inducing changes, duplicated functionality). Similarly, they provide managers with information that is relevant to make a certain decision (e.g., bug distribution when allocating resources).
