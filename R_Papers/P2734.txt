Social media for software engineering
Social media has changed the way that people collaborate and share information. In this paper, we highlight its impact for enabling new ways for software teams to form and work together. Individuals will self-organize within and across organizational boundaries. Grassroots software development communities will emerge centered around new technologies, common processes and attractive target markets. Companies consisting of lone individuals will able to leverage social media to conceive of, design, develop, and deploy successful and profitable product lines. A challenge for researchers who are interested in studying, influencing, and supporting this shift in software teaming is to make sure that their research methods protect the privacy and reputation of their stakeholders.
