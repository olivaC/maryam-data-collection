Refinement-based security analysis
A method, computer program product, and computer system for assigning, by a computing device, a value to a first data-flow of a first summary associated with a control flow graph and assigning the value to a second data-flow of a second summary associated with the control flow graph. The first data-flow with the value is identified to flow into a type of sink. The second data-flow with the value is identified not to flow into the type of sink. The first summary of a behavior of the first data-flow is refined in response to identifying that the first data-flow does flow into the type of sink. Refinement of the second summary of a behavior of the second data-flow is skipped in response to identifying that the second data-flow does not flow into the type of sink.
