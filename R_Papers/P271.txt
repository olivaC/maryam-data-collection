Enabling bring-your-own-device using mobile application instrumentation
Many enterprises are investigating Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies, which allow employees to use their personal devices in the workplace. This has led to mixed-use scenarios, where consumer and enterprise software are installed on the same device. In this paper, we describe the Secured Application Framework for Enterprise (SAFE), a comprehensive system for enabling BYOD that allows enterprise and consumer applications to coexist side-by-side on the device. Rather than partition the device by profiles, SAFE embeds enterprise functions in each enterprise application; this allows for a seamless user experience and minimal intrusiveness on the part of the enterprise. We describe the SAFE toolset that implements the embedding of the SAFE instrumentation layer, and then provide an overview of several enterprise features that can be configured using SAFE. Specifically, we describe modeling for analytics, testing and replay, anomaly detection, and cloud data services, all enterprise features that can transparently be added to mobile applications.
