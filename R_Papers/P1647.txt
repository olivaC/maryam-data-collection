A small-step semantics of PLEXIL
A key design principle of a high-level plan execution language is the ability to predict the output of a planning task under limited information on the external environment and on the platform where the plan is executed. This type of determinism is particularly critical in unmanned space exploration systems, such as robotic rovers, which are often deployed in a semi-autonomous mode. This paper proposes a formal framework for specifying the semantics of general plan execution languages based on NASA’ Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL), a rich concurrent language that is being developed in support of NASA’s Space Exploration Program. The semantic framework allows for the formal study of properties such as determinism for different assumptions on the knowledge of the external environment. The framework is organized as a stack of parametric layers defining the execution mechanism of a parallel synchronous eventdriven language. This modular presentation enables the instantiation of the framework to different semantic variants of PLEXIL-like languages. The mathematical development presented in this paper has been formalized and mechanically checked in the Program Verification System (PVS).
