An AADL-Based SysML Profile for Architecture Level Systems Engineering: Approach, Metamodels, and Experiments
Recent years have seen a proliferation of languages for describing embedded control systems. Some of these languages have emerged from domain-specific frameworks, and some are adaptions or extensions of more general-purpose languages. In this paper, we focus on two widely-used standard languages: the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). AADL was born as an avionics-focused domain-specific language and later on has been revised to represent and support a more general category of embedded real-time systems. SysML is an extension of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) intended to support modeling system engineering applications. We propose the ExSAM profile that extends SysML by adding AADL concepts to it with the goal of exploiting the key advantages of both languages in a seamless way. We describe this profile through several examples and compare it with existing alternatives. We have implemented ExSAM using IBM Rational Rhapsody and evaluated its completeness and usefulness through two case studies.
