A novel filter topology with active motor CM impedance regulator in PWM ASD system
This paper presents a novel hybrid output filter topology for the inverter-motor system. It is shown that the proposed filter drastically reduces the common mode (CM) voltage at the motor terminals. The proposed filter is composed of a conventional LC filter cascaded with an active motor CM impedance regulator. The active circuit, utilizing an integrated high-voltage op-amp, is very efficient in decreasing the motor CM equivalent capacitance, as well as damping the high common voltage on the motor terminal. Therefore, the motor impedance is also used as part of the filter, and the common voltage can be eliminated dynamically in the active impedance regulator by feedback control. Furthermore, the size of the passive filter can be reduced to a large extent. Experimental verification of the filter topology is provided with a laboratory system consisting of a 380-V inverter and a 0.37-kW induction motor.
