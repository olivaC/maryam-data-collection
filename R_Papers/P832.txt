Lightweight Integrity Protection for Web Storage-Driven Content Caching
Methods, systems, and computer-readable storage media for providing integrity protection for web storage-driven content caching. Implementations include receiving a web page from a server, the web page being associated with a script library and one or more items that can be stored in web storage of a web browser executed on a client computing device, each of the one or more items being associated with a pre-determined checksum value, and loading the script library, such that a local storage API is overwritten using a wrapper function, the script library being executable to, in response to a request for an item from web storage, perform operations including: determining a generated checksum value based on the item, and verifying an integrity of the item based on the generated checksum value and a pre-determined checksum value associated with the item.
