Testing of future internet applications running in the cloud
The cloud will be populated by Future Internet (FI) software, comprising advanced, dynamic and largely autonomic interactions among services, end-user applications, content and media. The complexity of the technologies involved in the cloud makes testing extremely challenging and demands novel approaches and major advancements in the field. This chapter describes the main challenges associated with the test of FI applications running in the cloud. We present a research agenda that was defined in order to address the FI testing challenges. The goal of the agenda is investigating the technologies for the development of a FI automated testing environment, which can monitor the FI applications under test and can react dynamically to the observed changes. Realization of this environment involves substantial research in areas such as search based testing, model inference, oracle learning and anomaly detection.
