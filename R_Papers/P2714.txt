An empirical investigation of a genetic algorithm for developer's assignment to bugs
Software development teams consist of developers with varying expertise and levels of productivity. With reported productivity variation of up to 1:20, the quality of assignment of developers to tasks can have a huge impact on project performance. Developers are characterized according to a defined core set of technical competence areas. The objective is to find a feasible assignment, which minimizes the total time needed to fix all given bugs. In this paper, the modeling of the developer’s assignment to bugs is given. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm called GA@DAB (Genetic Algorithm for Developer’s Assignment to Bugs) is proposed and empirically evaluated. The performance of GA@DAB was evaluated for 2040 bugs of 19 open-source milestone projects from the Eclipse platform. As part of that, a comparative analysis was done with a previously developed approach using K-Greedy search. Our results and analysis shows that GA@DAB performs statistically significantly better than K-greedy search in 17 out of 19 projects. Overall, the results support the argument of the applicability of customized genetic search techniques in the context of developer-to-bug assignments.
