Javalanche: efficient mutation testing for Java
To assess the quality of a test suite, one can use mutation testing - seeding artificial defects (mutations) into the program and checking whether the test suite finds them. Javalanche is an open source framework for mutation testing Java programs with a special focus on automation, efficiency, and effectiveness. In particular, Javalanche assesses the impact of individual mutations to effectively weed out equivalent mutants; it has been demonstrated to work on programs with up to 100,000 lines of code.
