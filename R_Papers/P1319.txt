Towards formal modeling and verification of cloud architectures: A case study on hadoop
Hadoop is a popular open source implementation of MapReduce, that has a number of prominent users including Yahoo!, Facebook, and Twitter. Though several works have focused on deploying algorithms on Hadoop MapReduce, research efforts into applying formal methods to prove the correctness of hadoop systems are limited. In this paper we propose a holistic approach to verify the correctness of hadoop systems using model checking techniques. We model Hadoop's parallel architecture to constraint it to valid start up ordering and identify and prove the benefits of data locality, deadlock-freeness and non-termination among others.
