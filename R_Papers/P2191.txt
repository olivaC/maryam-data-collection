Training classifiers for program analysis
Methods for training a static security analysis classifier include running an initial security analysis on a training codebase to generate a set of vulnerabilities associated with the training codebase; analyzing the program with a feature set that limits a number of detected vulnerabilities to generate a limited set of vulnerabilities associated with the feature set; comparing the limited set of vulnerabilities to a known vulnerability distribution to generate an accuracy score; and iterating the steps of analyzing and comparing using different feature sets to find a feature set having a highest accuracy score.
