Transforming unit tests for security testing
A method, computer program product, and system for transforming unit tests is described. A unit test associated with one or more software units is identified. A first input parameter of the unit test is identified. A substitute parameter value is determined, wherein the substitute parameter value is associated with a security test for the one or more software units. A value of the first input parameter in the unit test is replaced with the substitute parameter value. The unit test including the substitute parameter value is implemented for the one or more software units. A first security issue associated with the one or more software units is identified, based upon, at least in part, replacing the first input parameter of the unit test with the substitute parameter value and implementing the unit test including the substitute parameter value.
