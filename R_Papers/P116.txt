Clara: partially evaluating runtime monitors at compile time tutorial supplement
CLARA is a novel static-analysis framework for partially evaluating finite-state runtime monitors at compile time. CLARA uses static typestate analyses to automatically convert any AspectJ monitoring aspect into a residual runtime monitor that only monitors events triggered by program locations that the analyses failed to prove safe. If the static analysis succeeds on all locations, this gives strong static guarantees. If not, the efficient residual runtime monitor is guaranteed to capture property violations at runtime. Researchers can use CLARA with most runtime-monitoring tools that implement monitors as AspectJ aspects.In this tutorial supplement, we provide references to related reading material that will allow the reader to obtain in-depth knowledge about the context in which CLARA can be applied and about the techniques that underlie the CLARA framework.
