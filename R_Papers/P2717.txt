Collaborative software development in ten years: Diversity, tools, and remix culture
Over the next ten years, collaboration in software engineering will change in a number of ways and research will need to shift its focus to enable and enhance such collaboration. Specifically, we claim that software in the small will become more popular and even large software will be built by fewer people due to better tools. For large projects, research will need to address the collaboration needs of project members other than just developers, including quality assurance engineers, build engineers, architects, and operations managers. Finally, code reuse and sharing will change as a result of a growing software remix culture, leading to more loosely coupled and indirect collaboration.
