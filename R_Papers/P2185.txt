Identifying whether an application is malicious
Identifying whether a first application is malicious. The first application can be presented for installation on a processing system. The first application can be scanned, via a static analysis implemented by a processor, to determine whether a user interface layout of the first application is suspiciously similar to a user interface layout of a second application installed on the processing system. When the user interface layout of the first application is suspiciously similar to the user interface layout of the second application installed on the processing system, an alert can be generated indicating that the first application is malicious.
