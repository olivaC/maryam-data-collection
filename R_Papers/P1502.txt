Regression testing in the presence of non-code changes
Regression testing is an important activity performed to validate modified software, and one of its key tasks is regression test selection (RTS) -- selecting a subset of existing test cases to run on the modified software. Most existing RTS techniques focus on changes made to code components and completely ignore non-code elements, such as configuration files and databases, which can also change and affect the system behavior. To address this issue, we present a new RTS technique that performs accurate test selection in the presence of changes to non-code components. To do this, our technique computes traceability between test cases and the external data accessed by an application, and uses this information to perform RTS in the presence of changes to non-code elements. We present our technique, a prototype implementation of our technique, and a set of preliminary empirical results that illustrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and potential usefulness of our approach.
