A Survey of Physical Design Techniques of Information Systems-TEST
The physical design decisions taken during the database design lifecycle highly affect the database performance. These design decisions include the index structures used, which views can be materialized, how to partition the data etc. These decisions vary by the nature of the system being implemented. For example, the index structures used for disk-based database systems differ from those used in a memory-based database system. In this survey, we present the elements of physical design in different information systems. We start by describing the physical design of traditional disk-based relational database systems then compare it to other types of information systems. Specifically, we look at the physical design of Main Memory Database Systems (MMDB), XML Databases, and Data Warehouses. We examine how the specific nature of each of these systems affect its physical design. We focus on index structures, materialized views, partitioning, and clustering.
