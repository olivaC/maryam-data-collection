Automatic Choreography Repair
Choreography analysis is a crucial problem in concurrent and distributed system development. A choreography specifies the desired ordering of message exchanges among the components of a system. The realizability of a choreography amounts to determining the existence of components whose communication behavior conforms to the given choreography. Recently, the choreography realizability problem has been proved to be decidable. In this paper, we investigate the repairability of un- realizable choreographies, where the goal is to identify a set of changes to a given un-realizable choreography that will make it realizable. We present a technique for automatically repairing un-realizable choreographies and provide formal guarantees of correctness and termination. We show the viability of our technique by applying it successfully for several small but representative unrealizable choregraphies from the domain of Singulary OS contract and Web services.
