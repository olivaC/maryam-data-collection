Static analysis of computer software applications
Static analysis of a computer software application can be performed by applying a first level of abstraction to model a plurality of run-time objects, thereby producing a set of object abstractions. Static data-flow analysis of the computer software application can be performed using the set of object abstractions, thereby producing a first data-flow propagation graph. A data-flow bottleneck can be identified within the data-flow propagation graph. A second level of abstraction can be applied to model any of the run-time objects having in the set of object abstractions a corresponding object abstraction that is traceable to the data-flow bottleneck. The applying the second level of abstraction can decompose the corresponding object abstraction into a set of object abstractions, thereby modifying the set of object abstractions. Static data-flow analysis of the computer software application can be performed using the modified set of object abstractions.
