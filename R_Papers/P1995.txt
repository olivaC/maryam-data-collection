Cross-platform program analysis using machines learning based on universal features
A method for performing program analysis includes receiving programs of a first platform that have been assigned a first label and programs of the first platform that have been assigned a second label. Each of the programs of the first platform is expressed as platform-independent logical features. A discriminatory model or classifier is trained, using machine learning, based on the expression of the programs of the first platform as platform-independent logical features, to distinguish between programs of the first label and programs of the second label. An unlabeled program of a second platform is received and is expressed as platform-independent logical features. The trained discriminatory model or classifier is used to determine if the unlabeled program warrants the first label or the second label, based on the expression of the unlabeled program as platform-independent logical features.
