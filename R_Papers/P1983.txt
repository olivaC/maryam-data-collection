Warning filter based on machine learning
Techniques for generating a warning filter to filter the warnings output from a static program analysis tool are provided. In one example, a computer-implemented method comprises determining feature vector data for a set of warnings, wherein the set of warnings is generated in response to static analysis of a computer program, and wherein the feature vector data comprises a feature vector indicative of an attribute of a warning of the set of warnings. The computer-implemented method also comprises determining a warning filter that identifies a first subset of the set of warnings as representing true positives based on the feature vector data and classified warning data, and wherein the classified warning data represents a second subset of the set of warnings that have been classified to indicate whether respective members of the second subset are indicative of true positives.
