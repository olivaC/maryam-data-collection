Discovery of application vulnerabilities involving multiple execution flows
Methods and systems for security analysis of an application are disclosed. In accordance with one method, a flow-insensitive analysis is conducted on the application to obtain a set of potential vulnerabilities in the application. For each of the potential vulnerabilities, a relevant set of control flows that include the respective vulnerability is determined. Further, for each relevant set of control flows, a flow-sensitive analysis of at least one of the control flows in the corresponding relevant set is performed by a hardware processor to assess the validity of the respective vulnerability.
