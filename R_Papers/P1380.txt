Towards a Toolkit for Flexible and Efficient Verification under Fairness
Recent development on distributed systems has shown that a variety of fairness constraints (some of which are only recently defined) play vital roles in designing self-stabilizing population protocols. Current practice of system analysis is, however, deficient under fairness constraints. In this work, we present a Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) for flexible and efficient system analysis under fairness constraints. A unified algorithm is proposed to model check systems with different fairness (e.g., weak fairness, strong local fairness, strong global fairness) effectively. Partial order reduction which is effective for distributed system verifi- cation is extended to fair systems whenever possible. We show through empirical evaluation (on recent population protocols as well as benchmark systems) that PAT significantly outperforms the current practice of verification with fairness. We report that previously unknown bugs have been revealed using PAT against systems functioning under strong global fairness.
