Verifying a quantitative relaxation of linearizability via refinement
The recent years have seen increasingly widespread use of highly concurrent data structures in both multi-core and distributed computing environments, thereby escalating the priority for verifying their correctness. Quasi linearizability is a quantitative variation of the standard linearizability correctness condition to allow more implementation freedom for performance optimization. However, ensuring that the implementation satisfies the quantitative aspect of this new correctness condition is often an arduous task. In this paper, we propose the first automated method for formally verifying quasi linearizability of the implementation model of a concurrent data structure with respect to its sequential specification. The method is based on checking a relaxed version of the refinement relation between the implementation model and the specification model through explicit state model checking. Our method can directly handle concurrent systems where each thread or process makes infinitely many method calls. Furthermore, unlike many existing verification methods, it does not require the user to supply annotations of the linearization points. We have implemented the new method in the PAT verification framework. Our experimental evaluation shows that the method is effective in verifying the new quasi linearizability requirement and detecting violations.
