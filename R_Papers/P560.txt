Vulnerability Detection and Sanitization Synthesis
Web application development is error prone and results in applications that are vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. The global accessibility of Web applications makes this an extremely serious problem. According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)’s top ten list that identifies the most serious web application vulnerabilities, the top three vulnerabilities in 2007 [84] were: (1) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and (2) Injection Flaws (such as SQL Injection). Even after it has been widely reported that web applications suffer from these vulnerabilities, XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities remained among the top three vulnerabilities listed in OWASP’s top ten list in 2010 [85] and 2013 [86].
