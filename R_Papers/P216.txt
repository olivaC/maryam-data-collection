Evosuite: On the challenges of test case generation in the real world
Test case generation is an important but tedious task, such that researchers have devised many different prototypes that aim to automate it. As these are research prototypes, they are usually only evaluated on a few hand-selected case studies, such that despite great results there remains the question of usability in the “real world”. EVOSUITE is such a research prototype, which automatically generates unit test suites for classes written in the Java programming language. In our ongoing endeavour to achieve real-world usability, we recently passed the milestone success of applying EVOSUITE on hundred projects randomly selected from the SourceForge open source platform. This paper discusses the technical challenges that a testing tool like EVOSUITE needs to address when handling Java classes coming from real-world open source projects, and when producing JUnit test suites intended for real users.
