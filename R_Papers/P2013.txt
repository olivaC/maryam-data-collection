Reporting security vulnerability warnings
A computer-implemented method, computer program product, and computing system is provided for reporting security vulnerabilities. In an embodiment, a method may include receiving a set of potential security vulnerabilities associated with a program. The method may also include filtering the set of potential security vulnerabilities by eliminating one or more spurious security vulnerabilities to generate a set of likely security vulnerabilities. The method may further include consolidating the set of likely security vulnerabilities into one or more solution categories, each of the one or more solutions categories defining a solution for remedying each of the likely security vulnerabilities within the solution category.
