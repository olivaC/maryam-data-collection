Dynamically provisioning isolation in hierarchical architectures
Physical isolation provides tenants in a cloud with strong security guarantees, yet dedicating entire machines to tenants would go against cloud computing’s tenet of consolidation. A fine-grained isolation model allowing tenants to request fractions of dedicated hardware can provide similar guarantees at a lower cost. In this work, we investigate the dynamic provisioning of isolation at various levels of a system’s architecture, primarily at the core, cache, and machine level, as well as their virtualised equivalents. We evaluate recent technological developments, including post-copy VM migration and OS containers, and show how they assist in improving reconfiguration times and utilisation. We incorporate these concepts into a unified framework, dubbed SafeHaven, and apply it to two case studies, showing its efficacy both in a reactive, as well as an anticipatory role. Specifically, we describe its use in detecting and foiling a system-wide covert channel in a matter of seconds, and in implementing a multi-level moving target defence policy.
