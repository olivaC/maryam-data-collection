Traceability and SysML design slices to support safety inspections: A controlled experiment
Certifying safety-critical software and ensuring its safety requires checking the conformance between safety requirements and design. Increasingly, the development of safety-critical software relies on modeling, and the System Modeling Language (SysML) is now commonly used in many industry sectors. Inspecting safety conformance by comparing design models against safety requirements requires safety inspectors to browse through large models and is consequently time consuming and error-prone. To address this, we have devised a mechanism to establish traceability between (functional) safety requirements and SysML design models to extract design slices (model fragments) that filter out irrelevant details but keep enough context information for the slices to be easy to inspect and understand. In this article, we report on a controlled experiment assessing the impact of the traceability and slicing mechanism on inspectors' conformance decisions and effort. Results show a significant decrease in effort and an increase in decisions' correctness and level of certainty.
