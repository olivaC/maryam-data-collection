Detecting persistent vulnerabilities in web applications
A method, including storing a test payload to a persistent state of an application and performing a static analysis to identify a first code location in the application that retrieves the test payload, to identify a first path from an entry point to the first code location, and to identify a second path from the first code location to a second code location that executes a security sensitive operation using the retrieved data. A dynamic analysis is then performed to retrieve the test payload via the first path, and to convey the test payload to the second code location via the second path.
