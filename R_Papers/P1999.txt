System, method and apparatus for sensor virtualization in mobile devices
A method and system for virtualizing mobile device sensors includes requesting from a first mobile device a virtual connection with a mobile device having a specific type of sensor, receiving a response from a second mobile device having the sensor, establishing a trusted temporary communication connection between the first and second mobile devices, sending a control signal from an application program on the first mobile device to the second mobile for operating the sensor on the second mobile device and receiving device sensor data from the sensor on the second mobile device. The operating system of the first mobile device is coupled with the application program by a virtual machine monitor running on the first mobile device such that the first mobile device is a host machine and the second mobile device is a guest machine.
