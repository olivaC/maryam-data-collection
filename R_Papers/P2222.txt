Mining attack vectors for black-box security testing
Black-box security testing for a Web application includes identifying infrastructure supporting the Web application, obtaining vulnerability data for the Web application from an external data source according to the infrastructure, deriving a test payload from the vulnerability data using a processor, and determining a type of vulnerability exploited by the test payload. An existing validation operation of a testing system is selected for validating a response from the Web application to the test payload according to the type of vulnerability.
