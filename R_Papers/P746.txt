Dynamic detection of atomic-set-serializability violations
A method, an information processing system, and a computer readable medium, are used to detect atomic-set serializability violations in an execution of a program. A set of classes associated with a program to be analyzed is identified. The set of classes include a set of fields. At least one subset of fields in the set of fields in the identified classes is selected. A set of code fragments associated with an execution of the program is selected. Data accesses in the selected set of code fragments are observed. It is determined if the selected set of code fragments is serializable for each selected subset of fields.
