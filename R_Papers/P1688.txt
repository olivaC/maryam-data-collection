A scalable distributed concolic testing approach: An empirical evaluation
Although testing is a standard method for improving the quality of software, conventional testing methods often fail to detect faults. Concolic testing attempts to remedy this by automatically generating test cases to explore execution paths in a program under test, helping testers achieve greater coverage of program behavior in a more automated fashion. Concolic testing, however, consumes a significant amount of computing time to explore execution paths, which is an obstacle toward its practical application. To address this limitation, we have developed a scalable distributed concolic testing framework that utilizes large numbers of computing nodes to generate test cases in a scalable manner. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study that shows that the proposed framework can achieve a several orders-of-magnitude increase in test case generation speed compared to the original concolic approach, and also demonstrates clear potential for scalability.
