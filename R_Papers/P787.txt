Cooperative static and dynamic analysis of web application code for finding security vulnerabilities
Implementations of the present disclosure include methods, systems, and computer-readable storage media for receiving, by a SSCA module of a server, source code data based on one or more web pages of a website, analyzing, by the SSCA module, the source code data using static analysis to provide initial results, the initial results including identifiers respectively assigned to one or more variables provided in the source code data, transmitting, by the SSCA module, a request to the website through a proxy server, the request being based on the initial results, the proxy server receiving a response and transmitting a rewritten response to a DSCA module executed on a client, receiving, by the SSCA module, updated source code data from the DSCA module, the updated source code data being provided based on the rewritten response, and updating, by the SSCA module, the initial results based on the updated source code data.
