Attacks on the browser’s requests
By attacking the browser’s requests, an attacker is able to trick the user’s browser into sending requests to a target application. Since these requests originate from the user’s browser, a vulnerable application is unable to distinguish them from legitimate requests, thus allowing the attacker to perform actions in the user’s name. The two most common ways of forging requests from the user’s browser are cross-site request forgery (CSRF), where requests are automatically sent by the browser, and UI redressing, where the user is tricked into interacting with a seemingly innocent page, while the interactions are actually sent to the target application. Real-life attacks on vulnerable applications have allowed attackers to transfer money from bank accounts, take over accounts through the password reset feature or secretly enable the webcam in the Flash player.
