A comparative approach to supervisor simplification in automated manufacturing systems using Petri nets
Modern complex systems require intensive application of complicated supervisors. Structural simplification techniques are one of the fundamental researches in the context of automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). They can reduce implementation cost, mitigate fabrication complexity, and improve reliability. Several typical methods are developed along this direction. In order to thoroughly explore their effectiveness and performance, we make a comparison and contrast investigation among them. Several analytical results and performance measures are proposed for their qualitative and quantitative comparison. Our approach can assist researchers and practitioners better comprehend the inherit mechanisms and relative merits of these simplification methodologies and their applicability in AMSs. This research is motivated by AMSs' control; however, they are also applicable to other systems with discrete event controllers.
