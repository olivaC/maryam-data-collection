Eliminating false-positive reports resulting from static analysis of computer software
A system for eliminating false-positive reports resulting from static analysis of computer software is provided herein. The system includes the following components executed by a processor: a modeler configured to model a computer code into a model that defines sources, sinks, and flows; a static analyzer configured to apply static analysis to the code or the model, to yield reports indicative of at least one issue relating to one or more of the flows; a preconditions generator configured to generate preconditions for eliminating false-positive issues in the reports, based on the model and user-provided input; and a preconditions checker configured to apply the generated preconditions to the reports for eliminating false-positive issues in the reports.
