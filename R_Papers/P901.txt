Text-based Intelligent Content Filtering on Social Platforms
Social platforms have become one of the popular mediums of information sharing and communication over the Internet today. People share all types of contents such as text, images, audio and video using these social platforms. Though information gained using these social platforms can be very useful for people around the globe, some of the user generated contents are very negative as they contain abusive, racial, offensive and insulting material. Thus, there is a need for an effective online content filtering technique which blocks these negative contents while not disturbing the access of users to rest of the contents available on these sites. Current techniques simply filter on the basis of URLs blocking and keyword matching or either rely on a large database of pre-classified web addresses. The problem is how to intelligently filter the negative contents, rather than filtering entire websites using their URLs or applying simple keyword matching techniques. In this paper we review a number of existing approaches to content filtering and propose an intelligent content filtering technique that uses sentiment analysis of the text and feature engineering methods to perform text classification.
