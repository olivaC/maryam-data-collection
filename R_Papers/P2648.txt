Discovering and exploiting relationships in software repositories
Software development items can be represented in a graph data structure. Relationships between the represented items can be detected and reflected in the graph data structure. Queries can be run against the data structure to determine which software development items are related to each other. Implicit query can be implemented in a software development context. A graph browser can present panes showing related items.
In some embodiments, a set of regular expressions can be used to identify paths in a graph. Probability scores for the identified paths can be computed. Path data for the identified paths, including the probability scores, can be stored in a searchable location accessible by one or more applications. A query of the path data can be processed to return query results associated with at least one of the identified paths.
