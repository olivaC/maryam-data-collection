A bit of" Persona", a bit of" Goal", a bit of" Process"... a recipe for Analyzing User Intensive Software Systems.
The centrality of users in the design and development of complex systems, such as service-based applications, calls for new methodologies and techniques to extract and represent user needs and to translate them into real processes. In this short paper, we describe the integration of concepts and analysis techniques of different approaches, namely Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering, User-Centred Design and Process-Oriented Modeling, that are being developed in the context of two projects related to Ambient Assisted Living and Internet of Services.
