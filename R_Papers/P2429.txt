Efficient energy balancing aware multiple base station deployment for WSNs
Energy reduction is one of the major problems in the design of a wireless sensor network (WSN). Multiple base stations can be used to dramatically reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes. We consider the following problem of deploying k base stations in a wireless sensor network: Given a wireless sensor network where the location of each sensor node is known, partition the whole sensor network into k disjoint clusters and place one base station for each cluster such that the maximum total energy consumption of any cluster is minimised. We propose the first heuristic for this problem. The time complexity of our heuristic is O(kn 3), where n is the number of sensor nodes of the sensor network. In the special case where k is equal to 1, we propose a quadratic-time algorithm for optimally deploying the base station. Our simulation results show that our heuristic is efficient.
