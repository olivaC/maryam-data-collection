Predicting bugs from history
Version and bug databases contain a wealth of information about software failures— how the failure occurred, who was affected, and how it was fixed. Such defect information can be automatically mined from software archives; and it frequently turns out that some modules are far more defect-prone than others. How do these differences come to be? We research how code properties like (a) code complexity, (b) the problem domain, (c) past history, or (d) process quality affect software defects, and how their correlation with defects in the past can be used to predict future software properties—where the defects are, how to fix them, as well as the associated cost.
