The Dagstuhl Seminar 13141 “Formal Verification of Distributed Algorithms” brought together researchers from the areas of distributed algorithms, model checking, and semi-automated proofs with the goal to establish a common base for approaching the many open problems in verification of distributed algorithms. In order to tighten the gap between the involved communities, who have been quite separated in the past, the program contained tutorials on the basics of the concerned fields. In addition to technical talks, we also had several discussion sessions, whose goal was to identify the most pressing research challenges. This report describes the program and the outcomes of the seminar.
