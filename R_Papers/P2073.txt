Identifying stored vulnerabilities in a web service
A computer identifies each web method, of a web service, declared in a web services description language (WSDL) file. The computer adds a node within a directed graph for each web method identified. The computer identifies pairs of web methods declared in the WSDL file in which a match exists between an output parameter of one of the web methods and an input parameter of another one of the web methods. The computer adds an edge within the directed graph for each of the pairs of web methods identified. The computer generates one or more sequences of web methods based on nodes connected by edges within the directed graph, wherein each of the one or more sequences includes at least one of the pairs of web methods identified. The computer tests each of the one or more sequences of web methods to identify stored vulnerabilities in the web service.
