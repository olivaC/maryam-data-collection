Lifetime holes aware register allocation for clustered VLIW processors
This paper presents an on-the-fly register allocator which dynamically detects and utilises lifetime holes for clustered VLIW processors. A lifetime hole is an interval in which a variable does not contain a valid value. A register holding a lifetime hole can be allocated to another variable whose live range fits in the lifetime hole, leading to more efficient utilisation of registers. We propose efficient techniques for dynamically utilising lifetime holes and incorporate these techniques into our on-the-fly register allocator. We have simulated our register allocator and a linear scan register allocator without considering lifetime holes by using the MediaBench II benchmark suite. Our simulation results show that our register allocator reduces the number of spills by 12.5%, 11.7%, 12.7%, for three different processor models, respectively.
