Effective testing of authorization logic of web components which utilize claims-based authorization
An authorization algorithm of a software component can be selected. A static code analysis can be performed to determine a conditional statement within an algorithm of the software component. The outcome of the conditional statement can be established based on an input and a criteria using dynamic code analysis. The input can be a value associated with a claim set of a claims-based authentication policy. The criteria can be an authentication criteria specified within the algorithm. Responsive to the outcome, an execution path associated with the outcome can be determined and a code coverage criterion can be met for the conditional statement.
