Payload generation for computer software testing
A method of generating test payloads for a target system includes receiving a plurality of reference programs, each reference program modelling at least one aspect of the target system, building a specification for each received reference program, each specification defining illegal states for the respective reference program, analyzing each specification to determine one or more entry constraints that would generate an illegal state from a specific input, and synthesizing one or more payloads from the determined entry constraints.
