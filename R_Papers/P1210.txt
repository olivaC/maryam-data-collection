Battery-Aware Mobile Data Service
Significant research has been devoted to reduce the energy consumption of mobile devices, but how to increase their energy supply has received far less attention. Moreover, reducing the energy consumption alone does not always extend the device operation time due to a unique battery property - the capacity it delivers hinges critically upon how it is discharged. In this paper, we propose B-MODS, a novel design of battery-aware mobile data service on mobile devices. B-MODS constructs battery-friendly discharge patterns utilizing the recovery effect so as to increase the capacity delivered from batteries while meeting data service requirements. We implement B-MODS as an application layer library on the Android platform. Our experiments with diverse mobile devices under various application scenarios have shown that B-MODS increases the capacity delivery from the battery by up to 49.5 percent, with which an increase in the user-perceived data service utilities of up to 28.6 percent is observed.
