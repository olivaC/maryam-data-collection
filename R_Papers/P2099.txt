System and method for static detection and categorization of information-flow downgraders
A system and method for static detection and categorization of information-flow downgraders includes transforming a program stored in a memory device by statically analyzing program variables to yield a single assignment to each variable in an instruction set. The instruction set is translated to production rules with string operations. A context-free grammar is generated from the production rules to identify a finite set of strings. An information-flow downgrader function is identified by checking the finite set of strings against one or more function specifications.
