Exploring crowd consistency in a mechanical turk survey
Crowdsourcing can provide a platform for evaluating software engineering research. In this paper, we aim to explore characteristics of the worker population on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, a popular micro task crowdsourcing environment, and measure the percentage of workers who are potentially qualified to perform software- or computer science- related tasks. Through a baseline survey and two replications, we measure workers' answer consistency as well as the consistency of sample characteristics. In the end, we deployed 1,200 total surveys that were completed by 1,064 unique workers. Our results show that 24% of the study participants have a computer science or IT background and most people are payment driven when choosing tasks. The sample characteristics can vary significantly, even on large samples with 300 participants. Additionally, we often observed inconsistency in workers' answers for those who completed two surveys; approximately 30% answered at least one question inconsistently between the two survey submissions. This implies a need for replication and quality controls in crowdsourced experiments.
